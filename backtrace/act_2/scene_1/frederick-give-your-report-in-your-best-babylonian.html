<p>“Have you then?” asked Frederick.
<br><br>
“Most certainly I have.” Claudius replied. “Certain goblin factions are expressing extreme irritation and distress with your escape, a feeling which has ascended up the power structures sufficiently far as to procure a warrant for your arrest. It was discovered that you had stolen several objects from the ship&#39;s cargo bay, and that you had trampled about in the ship&#39;s computer system enough to gain access to sensitive data, which the goblins have claimed to be their&#39;s alone by Issuance 311 of the Galactic Information Council, even as this clearly contradicts a superordinate law, specifically Statute 531 of the Assembly for Free Information. The goblins are arguing, however, that due to the fact that all human military units are unwelcome within the Goblinactic System, the Core Transsystemal Warlock&#39;s Conference&#39;s 97th Amendment to the Lawyeriness Act (approved by the Grand Overseer of Pertitudinal Enactments himself, might I add) is invoked, thereby overruling the 9th Clause of Section 16 of the Interstellar Code for the Deployment of Strategic Fustianical Linguistics, meaning that we would have to appeal to the Ripöste im Tertiöe Article of the Unrelenting Cross-Operational Phülchkneerian –––”

<font color=#9bb38f>PSCR Readers: STOP</font>
<br><br>
Huh?
<br><br><font color=#9bb38f>
1) Stop this nonsense legalism. It&#39;s boring and we don&#39;t want to hear about it.
<br>
2) Recap please? It&#39;s been a while.
<br>
3) We want to hear Frederick speak Babylonian. Make him speak Babylonian.
</font><br><br>
O &hellip; kay &hellip; .
<br><br>
I mean &hellip; I might get back to the legal stuff. I mean, it&#39;s Claudius speaking, so &hellip; .
<br><br>
I was getting to the Babyl, I just had to &hellip; write down &hellip; Claudius giving his legal &hellip; yeah.
<br><br>
But I guess I can give you a recap anyway.

Guillotine Guardian: Recap
<br><br></font>
ACT I RECAP:
<br><br>
So, this started out with Frederick Hobbes, sitting, in an existential manner, in a prisoner&#39;s cell. That cell was located in the ship of Goblin Captain Marlvoch Tyronnus Seption, who, if we are given to understand correctly, has some kind of sinister plan to launch a galaxy-wide war, and in so doing, drive the ascension of the goblin species as one superior to all the others, with the others being wiped out or enslaved, or in some manner treated with a sincere lack of respect.
<br><br>
An interesting point about goblins is that they perpetually use old, outdated, clunky technology, meaning that whenever the army goes out to buy weaponry, they always obtain the most obscenely obsolescent pieces of quasi-modern machinery that they can find. Of course, this has never historically proved to be too much of a problem for them, in that they have always managed to find such a large number of these rusted out old workhorses for such a low amount of currency that quality never truly became a limiting factor to the quality of their military. However, there were several security issues in the years leading up to Frederick&#39;s imprisonment, and several of those issues still existed in the Fenestration models that the goblins used. Thus, Frederick was able to exit his cell by exploiting a security hole in the walls comprising the cell.
<br><br>
Upon escape, Frederick encountered some other being, who we later learn is a dwarf. He holds a general distaste for the goblins, and had just finished escaping from his own cell. The rapid approach of goblin soldiers prevented the two from truly bonding, however, and so each of them went his separate path. Frederick climbed amongst the ships understructures, and managed to travel, unharmed, to the ships turbine room. The turbine room itself was locked, however, and so Frederick stabbed the door control with his knife, which allowed him to enter the turbine room. Frederick subsequently sealed himself in the turbine control room, and proceeded to hack the computer system in an attempt to gain valuable information that might be useful to his superiors. In doing all this, he set off a mess of alarms and caused some lights to flicker, which made the Goblin Captain pretty angry.
<br><br>
That was Scene I.
<br><br>
In Scene II, we saw the Goblin Captain commanding the brutal torture of the earlier encountered dwarf in an attempt to gain information from him which he may or may not have had. The Goblin Captain then expounded upon his plans in his mind, which we have, for some reason, a unique perspective on the none of us can really explain. The Goblin Captain consulted with the Oracle of Kolei, who gave him a rather disappointing session in the fortune-telling chambers, saying only that “His greatest enemy would most certainly fall”. This lack of information irritated the Goblin Captain to the point where he dunked his head in a vat of sulfurous acid he had prepared in his private quarters, which has a pH of something roughly equivalent to lemon juice. He received a letter from his old friend Thornico Rujickmoli, in which Thornico said that he would be visiting the Goblin Captain&#39;s ship. The Goblin Captain was very pleased with this, and so stripped himself of his clothes and went running around the ship corridors in the buff. This apparently starts a small fashion trend amongst those in the ship.
<br><br>
That was Scene II.
<br><br>
In Scene III, Frederick copies sensitive data onto a flash card, which he plans to show to his superiors. The goblins became very fed up with him, however, and so they blew down the door to the turbine room in an effort to ferret him out. Frederick had transported a martial arts suit through the ships appearifier system, and so managed to easily defeat the naked goblins who came in after him, as well as the clothed one who didn&#39;t seem to think much of the new fashion trend. Frederick snatched the data card, pressed the enter key on the computer consul in the turbine room, and was immediately transportalized to the docking bay. There, Frederick encounters the dwarf once again. Frederick picks up the dwarf, as he has been wounded in his leg, and he begins to run towards a nearby open fighter. Frederick threatens to blow the ship up if the Goblin Captain doesn&#39;t open the doors, and so the Goblin Captain complies. A fighter crew is dispatched from the ship to take Frederick out soon thereafter; they are blown up by heavy explosives synthesized in the goblin laboratories.
<br><br>
That was Scene III. Claudius&#39; ship, because of Claudius&#39; own foresight, then came by and picked up Frederick and the dwarf, whose name, apparently, is Gomwell Isbard.

Frederick: Give your report in your best Babylonian.
<br><br></font>
….
After Claudius explained the nonsense legalisms concerning Frederick, Claudius asked Frederick to give his report.
<br><br>
“Why should I need to?” asked Frederick.
<br><br>
“Because I want to hear how you took the whole thing in. As well, it would enlighten the rest of the crew.”
<br><br>
“I&#39;m a bit rusty at report-giving.”
<br><br>
“Try your best.”
<br><br>
Frederick readied himself, and then spoke. “Bear han ey val orl mare. Soo ed na treiy––”
<br><br>
“Your Babylonian is rusty.” Claudius said.
<br><br>
“Like I said, my report-giving just isn&#39;t at its best.”
<br><br>
“Why don&#39;t you attempt to do so in your native tongue?”
<br><br>
Frederick proceeded to give a report to Claudius and the crew that sounded very much like the recap that I gave you.
<br><br>
“And where is that flash card?” asked Claudius after Frederick had finished.
<br><br>
Frederick procured it from the folds of his cloak.
<br><br>
“What precisely is on the flash card?” asked Hugo.
<br><br>
“I personally have no idea, but I know that the goblins were concerned enough about the contents that they were willing to go put through an insane amount of security to keep it safe.”
<br><br>
At this moment, the dwarf walked onto the bridge. He looked a fair deal better than when Frederick had last seen him. His wounds had been healed for the most part, and he didn&#39;t seem to be pained by walking.
<br><br>
“Gomwell!” Frederick cried. “Good to see you back on your feet.”
<br><br>
Gomwell took a short bow. “I must say that I do feel significantly better than when I arrived, good sir.”
<br><br>
A moment of slightly awkward silence ensued.
<br><br>
Frederick then asked, “What now?”</p>
