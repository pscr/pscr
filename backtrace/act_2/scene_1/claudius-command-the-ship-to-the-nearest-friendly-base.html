<p>Hugo walked onto the bridge. Frederick insisted that he go, since he felt it probable that he would be indisposed in the bathroom for a lengthy period of time. He sat down, and watched as Claudius sat, gazing at the goblin ship before him. It was an enormity of a ship, huge, ugly and gigantic, threatening in both its design and dimensions. It had been faltering, but it was back online, fully operational, and it was speeding for the O&#39;Malley star cruiser.
<br><br>
“Crew, prepare for the hyperspace jump.” Claudius said.
<br><br>
“Aye, captain!” the crew responded.
<br><br>
Claudius rose from his normal post and walked to the front of the bridge.
<br><br>
“Ready for jump, captain!”
<br><br>
“Jump.”
<br><br>
A rather quick jolt shook the mass of the ship, and the customary blinking lights of hyperspace flashed outside.
<br><br>
“Proceed to the nearest Allied base.” Claudius commanded.
<br><br>
“Aye, captain!”
<br><br>
A flash of light appeared in front of them, and a blackness followed. All present knew this was a sign of a jump made by another ship close by. The O&#39;Malley ship quickly turned about its axis to face the other way, and it started away from the darkness.
<br><br>
“In case of a confrontation, we&#39;re screwed.” Hugo commented.
<br><br>
“This is true.” Claudius replied.
<br><br>
“And their ship is a fair deal more powerful than ours.”
<br><br>
“Also true.”
<br><br>
“So then how exactly are we planning to get out of this mess?”
<br><br>
“We are not alone.”
<br><br>
Hugo looked at the view ports facing the back of the ship. The goblins were slowing, turning around, and starting the other way. He looked back in front, and began to perceive other ships. They began as specks of black against the infinite horizon of hyperspace, and grew to cruisers, fighters, and battleships.
<br><br>
“I wouldn&#39;t have thought &hellip; .” Hugo began.
<br><br>
“For Frederick, Hugo?” Claudius replied. “Who would not?”
