<br><br>
The captain of the O&#39;Malley star cruiser swept through hyperspace. He looked out the window, gazing at the red and blue flashing lights of eleven-dimensional space. Or at any rate, he took the word of the scientists that he was gazing out at the red and blue flashing lights of eleven-dimensional space. Which is to say, he didn&#39;t believe a word coming from the mouths of “The Great Minds” concerning the slightest about eleven-dimensional space. The captain felt that of all the feculent beings that he had ever meet or seen or heard or heard of, The Great Minds were probably the most feculent of all. Not only were they feculent, but they were also by far the most narcissistic beings in existence, which is of course to say that they were all that much more feculent.
<br><br>
The captain was trying his best to take things easy. One would have no idea just how hard running a ship was by looking at the captain. The shades said it all; this was one real cool dude that was sitting in the executive chair. There he was, just chilling, taking his time, and chilling, trying not to freak the hell out from the stress of all the irons he had in the fire, so to speak. He was just being real cool.
<br><br>
“Hugo, out.” the captain of the ship said to him. Hugo leaped up and stood at attention before the captain.
<br><br>
“And for the last time Hugo, loose the bloody shades.”
<br><br>
“Yes sir!” Hugo replied to the captain. He had had a good time in the true captain&#39;s temporary absence, but was more than ready to obey his superior.
<br><br>
“Everybody else,” the captain said, “Loose all this horseplay. Margo, off with the eye patch. Chuck, ditch those weird two-phase transition goggles.” Both crew members complied with the captain&#39;s command.
<br><br>
“You make it boring for the crew, sir.” Hugo told the captain frankly as the others got back to their normal activities. The true captain of the ship looked up at the red-clad figure of Hugo DeMárez.
<br><br>
“Can&#39;t be all fun and play, Hugo.”
<br><br>
“We can try.”
<br><br>
“Sit down, Hugo.” the captain said gently.
<br><br>
“Yes sir.”
<br><br>
Hugo took his place to the right of the captain. As second in command, he was the guardian of the crew and the ship for the periods of time where the captain of time was not on active duty. Now that the captain was back on duty, Hugo was removed from his place as the Temporary Despot of the Claudian Regime.
<br><br>
Claudius was the name of the captain. His other name was not known to the crew, and no one really knew why. He was simply Claudius. He had been named after some chap from the olden times, but due to some strange, incomprehensible agreement between two slightly unstable omniscient beings, Claudius&#39; other name and the details of the story behind his name had failed to ever materialize. It is, in fact, a distinct possibility that one of the omniscient parties involved in the agreement was breaking his (or her, we aren&#39;t entirely sure) side of the contract by even allowing for someone within his Time Partition to even so much as be named Claudius. Due to the very kind and gentle nature of the other party, however, the agreement was preserved , and so the two parties were allowed to remain in peace and harmony with each other. At any rate, this course of events is what had been handed down for generations in order to explain the lack of Claudius&#39; second name.
<br><br>
That was another odd thing about Claudius. He had lived longer than most could count, yet he looked to not be a day older than forty, and he maintained all the agility and grace of a forty year old. No one knew precisely how old he was, and those few who might refused to say. As for Claudius himself, he carried and handled himself in such a manner as to make one afraid to ask about his age, not simply because one should perhaps fear Claudius&#39; anger, but more because it was something one just <em>would not ask</em>. As a whole, Claudius was a mystery to all.
<br><br>
“Exit hyperspace.” he called out from his chair. The crew wondered why exactly Claudius chose to come out of hyperspace at this exact moment, but they trusted him, and to a certain extent, believed in him, and so they did what he asked. The epileptic flashing around them ceased, and they all found themselves gazing at a single goblin fighter drifting in the night, a half-disabled goblin ship following it from a distance.
<br><br>
“Extract the crew from the fighter.” he commanded his men. “Hugo, go see to it that it is done.”
<br><br>
Hugo was rather surprised that he, the second in command, should be chosen to head such a small expedition as merely extracting a fighter crew, but he threw out a quick, “Yes sir!” anyway. He had learned over the years that you simply <em>did not ask Claudius</em>.
<br><br>
“He&#39;s a friend!” Claudius called to Hugo over his shoulder.
<br><br>
Hugo ran ahead of the four others with him towards the docking bay. He swiped his key card at the bay entry door and opened it. The tractor beams had already guided the ship to its landing in the docking bay. Hugo watched carefully as the fighter door opened. A figure reminiscent of someone with whom Hugo was well acquainted emerged from the ship, carrying a small bundle rapped in cloth. The figure handed the bundle off to one of the present guards to be dealt with. Hugo examined the figure from afar.
<br><br>
The figure stood, his left hand balled up into a fist and resting on his hips. A purple cape hung from his shoulders, and a long blue rod was in his right hand. An air of victory pervaded the air around him. The figure twisted, shaking his head to one side, as if to clear away some imaginary clod of hair obstructing his vision. The unnamed person looked in all respects to be a valiant knight, come home to his castle after successfully slaying the dragon that had been terrifying the countryside.
<br><br>
The figure had seen Hugo, and knew who Hugo was, even from afar, just as Hugo knew the figure. Hugo rushed towards the man and leaped atop him.
<br><br>
“Whoa, didn&#39;t think you&#39;d be so happy to see me!” Frederick said to Hugo.
<br><br>
All that Hugo could do was shout joyous expletives at the arrival of his childhood friend, Frederick Hobbes.
<br><br>
“Frederick, I haven&#39;t seen you in ages!” he said to him.
<br><br>
“You impressed?” asked Frederick.
<br><br>
“With wha—oh, yes indeed! The royal color suits you well! Look, I&#39;ve preserved my way of dress from years past.”
<br><br>
“You were always better playing below yourself, weren&#39;t you. The shades are a bit too much though.”
<br><br>
“Eh, it&#39;s part of the charm.”
<br><br>
“Oh, the irony.”
<br><br>
The two looked at each other straight-faced for a moment, and then burst out laughing at the inside joke.
<br><br>
“Come now,” Hugo said at last, “Claudius well be expecting us.”
<br><br>
“Claudius?” Frederick inquired. “Surely you don&#39;t mean &hellip; .”
<br><br>
“Oh yes, in the flesh! The captain of this whole kit and caboodle!”
<br><br>
“Is he <em>still</em> doddering around? My gosh, he must be nearing three hundred at this point!”
<br><br>
“Yes, been counting down the whole time until the day he could start putting down the revolts!”
<br><br>
Frederick stared at Hugo blankly.
<br><br>
“Okay, yeah, I know that one was sad.” Hugo said.
<br><br>
“Yes, yes it was. You should be ashamed of yourself. Hang thine head in shame, child.”
<br><br>
Hugo did so. They both laughed as they began walking with the rest of the group back towards the bridge.
<br><br>
“What are you doing in this infernal dump anyway?” asked Frederick.
<br><br>
“This is not an infernal dump.” Hugo replied, indignant. “It is the height of Malusine engineering.”
<br><br>
“Malusine? Really?”
<br><br>
“Malus, Malusine, you can see what I mean. Anyway, I could ask you the same.”
<br><br>
“Pft. I&#39;ll have to tell Claudius, so I won&#39;t bother repeating myself to you, no offense.”
<br><br>
“Claudius is Claudius.”
<br><br>
“True enough.”
<br><br>
The group entered the bridge. The captain&#39;s chair swiveled around such that the occupant could face them, and the captain declared, “Frederick! I&#39;ve been waiting for you!”</p>
