<p>“I suppose we both go down to bar and have some celebratory drinks, then?” suggested Hugo.
<br><br>
“Sounds alright to me.” Frederick replied. “What would we be celebrating, though?”
<br><br>
“Reunion with old friends.”
<br><br>
“Good enough an excuse as any.”
<br><br>
Hugo and Frederick left the bridge and walked with each other towards the bar. Hugo was quiet, and despite Frederick&#39;s strongest attempts to engage him.
<br><br>
“What&#39;s up, Hugo?” Frederick said at last. “I&#39;ve never seen you this quiet.”
<br><br>
“Just &hellip; . I don&#39;t know. Things are happening. I know there&#39;s trouble brewing.”
<br><br>
“Ah, it&#39;s nothing. It&#39;ll get worked out fairly towards our advantage. The goblins will be forced to apologize for what they did, there will be a short period of political awkwardness, and then it&#39;ll fade. It&#39;s how these things always work.”
<br><br>
“Yeah, this is different though. I mean, you found no orders whatsoever commanding your ships destruction.”
<br><br>
“And?”
<br><br>
“I probably missed it.”
<br><br>
“You miss nothing. You&#39;re a better hacker by half than the chumps we have working in intelligence. If you didn&#39;t find it, it simply never existed. If it had, and it had simply been removed, you could have found it and restored it anyway. But you never came across a trace of it.”
<br><br>
“So?”
<br><br>
“Every goblin command comes down from someone on top. So then who on top authorized the destruction? More importantly, how did they do so in such a manner as to avoid making a paper trail?”
<br><br>
“You&#39;re suggesting insubordination on the part of the young goblin captain piloting that ship.”
<br><br>
“Do you see a clearer option?”
<br><br>
“I don&#39;t see, even if that was true, how that would be more intimidating a thought than a command handed down from high-on supreme.”
<br><br>
“I don&#39;t know, I guess. It&#39;s just, I&#39;ve never seen insubordination on the part of the goblin military. It&#39;s something entirely different from anything I&#39;ve ever seen, and I find it worrisome.”
<br><br>
“If it was insubordination, the goblins are not prepared for war in all likelihood. If they are not prepared for war, than there is no way in hell that they would take any course of action regarding this that would cause us to declare war on them. Therefore, I feel that my good goblin captain will soon be out of a job, and varied, miscellaneous vital organs as well.”
<br><br>
“Yeh, I guess. I simply have a hard time believing that anyone could be that stupid.”
<br><br>
The two walked into the bar and both seated themselves.
<br><br>
“Some people are.” Frederick replied.
<br><br>
“The goblins, not so much.”
<br><br>
“The goblins are a very intelligent race.”
<br><br>
The bartender came by to take their orders.
<br><br>
“Just a tonic.” Hugo said.
<br><br>
“Mechanical Bull.” Frederick said.
<br><br>
Hugo looked at Frederick strangely.
<br><br>
“Of everything I have ever ordered here, that it the worst.” he said.
<br><br>
“It&#39;s absolutely disgusting. I know. I like it anyway.”
<br><br>
“Sadomasochist.” Hugo mumbled. Frederick heard the comment, but disregarded it.
<br><br>
“I suppose I shouldn&#39;t say they&#39;re intelligent. I mean, they are, but not much more than we are, say. It would be better to say that they are exceedingly clever. When they apply themselves to the matter at hand, they are some of the greatest tacticians and strategists the galaxy has ever known. Even so, they tend to act quickly and on impulse. They have an inflated view of their own cleverness, and this compromises it. In the end, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it was an insubordination. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised either if it was a command handed down from the top of the chain.”
<br><br>
“Whatever.”
<br><br>
The bartender handed the both of them their drinks. Frederick flashed the libation card at Hugo for a moment, and then stuck it between his teeth as he rode the card with the drink in a manner truly suiting the drink itself. He sat for a moment, and then excused himself to the lavatory.</p>
