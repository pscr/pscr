<br><br>
Herald sat in the ruler&rsquo;s court.
<br><br>
“I have information which you seek.”
<br><br>
The prefect hiked up his eyebrows slightly.
<br><br>
“So says all. Concerning what?”
<br><br>
“A living incorrigible.”
<br><br>
“How old?”
<br><br>
“Past infancy.”
<br><br>
The prefect leaned forward.
<br><br>
“And so? We take the incorrigible out and put him to the sword. We shall discover him someday without your help.”
<br><br>
“I should think you should be more scared of this one than that. He is an abnormal one.”
<br><br>
“All incorrigibles are abnormal. That&rsquo;s why we get rid of them. Clean the stock, make sure that we preserve Aurelian purity.”
<br><br>
“And if that stock were to become corrupted?”
<br><br>
“Impossible. Aurelian customs would not permit it. Any Aureli who would have children with an incorrigible we would not want to have as part of the genetic stock in the first place, and since the Aureli bind to those they first &hellip; well, you understand I&rsquo;m sure. And besides, we haven&rsquo;t had an incorrigible who lived much past the age of eighteen in over a hundred years. Even if we failed to catch him, he would die before he could too much harm.”
<br><br>
“The child is in perfect health.”
<br><br>
“A slow manifestation of the genetic impurities.”
<br><br>
“I would think not.”
<br><br>
Herald smiled with a knowing which worried the prefect. He had dealt with Herald once or twice before, and had come to know that smile.
<br><br>
“You know something that I don&rsquo;t.” the prefect said.
<br><br>
“Maybe I do, maybe I don&rsquo;t.”
<br><br>
“What do you know that I don&rsquo;t?”
<br><br>
“It has to do with his DNA.”
<br><br>
“Oh? Tell me more.” the prefect leaned forward in mock surprise.
<br><br>
“It is not complete.”
<br><br>
“And so? How does that relate to him living a longer life.”
<br><br>
“It means that those sites at which we would see mutations adversely affecting lifespan do not exist in his body.”
<br><br>
“Shocking. And missing them is better?”
<br><br>
“It would appear so.”
<br><br>
“That makes little sense genetically.”
<br><br>
“Yet I have the proof.”
<br><br>
Herald waved a small envelope. It was taken from him and given to the prefect.
<br><br>
“How fascinating.” the prefect said, examining its contents. “And you believe that this will lead to a long life? And the possibility of his putting on some show against how we treat these incorrigibles by extension?”
<br><br>
“It very well might.”
<br><br>
“Well, what&rsquo;s the problem with him? If all it is is he has a few deleted genes, what&rsquo;s the big fuss? So what? Who cares? No one ever has to know.”
<br><br>
“Tell me sir: do you believe in ghosts?”
<br><br>
“What does that have to do with anything?”
<br><br>
“A matter of example.”
<br><br>
The prefect thought.
<br><br>
“I suppose that their existence is a possibility, but I don&rsquo;t really think one way or another about them.”
<br><br>
“Poor agnostic, confused as always.  But if you saw one you could recognize it as what it was?”
<br><br>
“I suppose I could, yes.” the prefect replied, angered at Herald&rsquo;s insult.
<br><br>
“Think of a ghost&rsquo;s color. It&rsquo;s translucency. Think of how intangible it appears. That is this child&rsquo;s skin.”
<br><br>
“I see. How awkward.”
<br><br>
“Yes. An incorrigible, whose genetic mutations might indeed lead to his living longer, has skin which you can nearly see through. It is near possible to see his bones, I am told, if merely for the fact that they appear to be a more solid color. His blood is clear. Not a trace of color. How he lives, we do not know. Yet he does.”
<br><br>
“Well, now that you have told me of this child&rsquo;s existence, I could simply have my men add such a child&rsquo;s description to my patrols' biweekly check for incorrigibles.”
<br><br>
“Ah, but you have no idea where the child is. In fact, you aren&rsquo;t even sure if the child is in your precinct.”
<br><br>
The prefect laughed. “If the child is not in my precinct, what concern is it of mine?! You are a funny one, Herald!”
<br><br>
“It is true that it would be another&rsquo;s concern were the child in another&rsquo;s precinct. This is merely a gross illustration of the fact that you have no idea where the incorrigible is.”
<br><br>
“I know him to be in my precinct, for one.”
<br><br>
“Which happens to be thousands of square miles. Your search force is formidable, I will say, but what if the incorrigible&rsquo;s protector were to find out about an intensified search? She would flee, no doubt, from your precinct. And then matters could become very messy very quickly in a very political manner.”
<br><br>
The prefect thought. “Alright, so you have information. Now what?”
<br><br>
“What will you give me for this information?”
<br><br>
The prefect was not shocked by Herald&rsquo;s boldness.
<br><br>
“Son, what if I were to tell you your life depends upon you giving me this information? How about I give you your right to keep living?”
<br><br>
“Nay, because my life I would have had without ever having come here, and my life is indeed a right, and not a privilege. I need more.”
<br><br>
The prefect glanced at one of his servants, and after some thought, nodded to him. The servant opened and presented a small box to Herald.
<br><br>
“Is this enough to suit you?” the prefect asked.
<br><br>
“Quite. You give this to me, I will tell you where to find the information.”
<br><br>
“I think not. You will tell us now.”
<br><br>
“And then what assurance have I that you will not then kill me? None whatsoever. I demand payment now. You shall get your information.”
<br><br>
“And then what guarantee have I that you will not run, and your information will prove to be false? None whatsoever.”
<br><br>
“Fine. Give half to me now, and if you are satisfied, you will send the other half to this address.”
<br><br>
“Fine. That will work nicely.”
<br><br>
Herald left, carrying with him a fair amount of wealth.
<br><br>
“Beryl!” the prefect called out.
<br><br>
“Yes, m'Lord.”
<br><br>
“I want that bastard dead after we deal with this incorrigible.”
<br><br>
“Yes, m'Lord.
<br><br><hr /><br>
The Mater scooped Patiens up and took him down to the cellar. Her hand trembled as she reached to turn the knob of the door leading to the hidden room. The trudging of heavy feet sounded throughout the  house as she walked in and sealed the door. She walked to a dark corner and curled up with her child. She looked at him. He looked scared, yet seemed confident in his mother. The Mater held no such confidence in herself.
<br><br>
For three years the Mater had barely earned a living, as she had always done. She had scraped by on what little she had managed to earn. The meager pay that she received three years ago had barely held then, and now her resources were stretched even tighter with the necessity to feed another.
<br><br>
For three years the Mater had managed to hide Patiens and his abnormality from the people around her. She rarely took him out. When she did take him out, it was always under the guise of his being her nephew. He always wore long, dark clothes in public, and was never seen by daytime.
<br><br>
For three years the Mater had clothed him and bathed him. She had shooshed him when he cried, and laughed when he smiled. The Mater watched Patiens grew, and rejoiced in his growth. For three years, she had been a mother to Patiens as Patiens had been a son to her.
<br><br>
And now after three years, short in the Mater&rsquo;s eyes, a lifetime in Patiens', the both of them were in danger for their lives, the Mater for her actions and Patiens for his existence. A hard thud resounded from the floor above. The ladder leading to the cellar creaked and moaned with the weight of several. There were shouts in some obscure language unrecognized by either of them. The Mater feared.
<br><br>
The knob turned, even as it was locked, and the door swung open. The Elder walked in, dressed in military regalia, and looked the Mater in the eye. He sat on the floor of the cellar and motioned for the Mater to give Patiens to him. The Mater fearfully let go of her child, and the Elder held the child close to himself. The Elder observed the child&rsquo;s abnormality. He too knew of the customs of the Aureli, and what would be done with the child if his abnormality were to be revealed. The Elder looked at Patiens, and then gave him back to his mother.
<br><br>
The Elder ascended, and went to walk out. He turned to the Mater as he entered the door frame.
<br><br>
“It is good that we found you first. They are looking for you. They have heard rumors. How the child&rsquo;s plight became known to them, I know not. There is treachery here, yet it is discreet and well hidden. You must remain here for three days, never wandering out of this space.”
<br><br>
“But how shall I feed him?”
<br><br>
“There is food in the corner.”
<br><br>
The Mater looked over and observed a block of cheese and a few loafs of bread.
<br><br>
“It will keep you for three days,” the Elder continued, “but no more. Eat all of it, but be careful not to consume it all on the first day and have no more for the other two.”
<br><br>
“What then? I shall lose my job. I will be unable to feed him after that.”
<br><br>
“On the night before the fourth day, you must flee. Go East. The capital is North,  there is famine in the South, and rebellion ravages the West. The jungles of the east shall serve to protect you and Patiens, and you shall be provided for there.”
<br><br>
“How do you know his name?”
<br><br>
“He told me.”
<br><br>
The Mater sat confused for a moment, and then looked over at the food.
<br><br>
“I shall do as you command.”
<br><br>
“His life depends upon it.”
<br><br>
“Who are you?”
<br><br>
“It is unnecessary that you should know. Know only that I act as an intermediary. Grasp that, and you have the root of the matter. Farewell, good woman. See to it that all is done right.”
