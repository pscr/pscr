<p>Linus rolled back out onto the gutter system in a fit of rage. He considered going to Kringle or an otherwise close friend, but such a thought was fleeting, as Kringle, nor anyone else, was his “close friend”. He spun about in his glass orb, rolling about the building. He came up to a hamster, who seemed to hold no special qualities whatsoever (aside from his ability to talk). The hamster turned to him, saying, “&#39;Sup.”
<br><br>
Linus scowled at the furry little creature, and imagined how if he had a body he would crush all of his kind in his left hand.
<br><br>
“How&#39;s it goin&#39;?” the hamster asked.
<br><br>
“Why am I even talking to you?”
<br><br>
“Beats me. I&#39;m Louis.”
<br><br>
“Like I really care.”
<br><br>
“Yes sir. Louis the Hamster. Pleasure to meet you.”
<br><br>
“Forgive me if I fail to reciprocate the feeling.”
<br><br>
“Not a problem, sir, not a problem at all. What brings you here today?”
<br><br>
“I don&#39;t have a body, damn it! Isn&#39;t it rather obvious?! And because I haven&#39;t a body, I&#39;m rolling around in a ball and talking to hamster, god of thunder help me!”
<br><br>
“Well, there isn&#39;t any shame in talking to a hamster, sir, if you don&#39;t mind my saying so, nor in not having a body. But I was specifically referring to being here, at the stock exchange, not in the gutter system.”
<br><br>
“What does it look like, you dolt? I&#39;m a trader. We have tools like you to run around on the information exchange system.”
<br><br>
“I would have well expected both sir. Simply making conversation.”
<br><br>
“You&#39;re a poor excuse for a creature, you know that?”
<br><br>
Louis looked rather hurt by this comment. “Sir, my profession is just as important as yours, if not more so.”
<br><br>
“Running around the stock exchange floor is more important then making the money funding your existence? Yeah right.”
<br><br>
The hamster nodded and looked away, as if he suddenly remembered the position that society had carved out for him.
<br><br>
“Why do we even use you anyway.” Linus wondered aloud.
<br><br>
“Ah, that, sir, is a long and complicated question. I could explain it, but it would require my binding you to secrecy, and my taking you to a secret place, away from the atrium.”
<br><br>
“Why would I listen to the explanation of a hamster?”
<br><br>
“Sir, we are not emotionless, unthinking creatures. We have a society. We socialize. We group together. We talk, and think, and work.”
<br><br>
“You live a privileged existence.”
<br><br>
“Indeed we do.”
<br><br>
There was silence for a moment.
<br><br>
“Would you care to visit?” asked the hamster.
<br><br>
“Visit what?”
<br><br>
“My home.”
<br><br>
Linus thought.</p>
