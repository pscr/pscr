<p>Linus Stockstad waited, and thought to himself. Besides shouting obscenities at passersby (which wouldn&#39;t have been a very wise thing to do), Linus did not have much to amuse himself with besides his mind. He estimated the derivatives of a few of the arches in the atrium which he was in, and then took a rough integral of a certain glass orb which he held a particular enmity towards. Oh, how he despised that glass orb. He hated every square centimeter of its surface, every cubic inch of its volume. He felt like spitting at it in disgust, and he surely would have had he been sure it wouldn&#39;t have landed right back in his face.</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>“Orb&#39;s almost ready, boss.” one of Linus&#39; hired workers called out to him.</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>“Gah!” Linus replied. “I hate that thing. How long till the FutureTech deal goes through, eh?”
<br><br></p>

<p>“It&#39;s a fair deal of money, boss. Probably eight months to a year.”</p>

<p><br><br> </p>

<p>“Bah!”</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>Linus looked to the left as best he could. The display cluster with the tech companies&#39; numbers flashed FutureTech&#39;s share price for a moment.</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>“They&#39;ve enough money, I&#39;d think they&#39;d expedite the process a bit! Especially since I&#39;m the one giving them money here!”</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>“There&#39;s a lot of stuff to sort out, boss. Official records and that sort of thing.”</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense. And didn&#39;t I say I wanted the deal off the books?”</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>“They won&#39;t budge, boss.”</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>“Well tell them if they want their money than they ought to keep it off the damn books.”</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>“They know they&#39;re the only game in town, boss. They can just say no.”</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>“Damn it, Kringel, this isn&#39;t some anti-drug propaganda campaign! I want that tech, and I want it soon!”</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>“Only so much we can do, boss. The orb&#39;s clean. You want it?”</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>“Fah! Just pick me up and carry me over, will ya?”</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>“Sure thing, boss.”</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>Kringel bent down slightly and picked Linus up. “You lose some weight boss?” Kringel asked jokingly. Linus glared back. Kringel knew better than to push it.
<br><br>
Kringel, who had one name only, carried Linus Stockstad, who was indeed just a head.</p>
