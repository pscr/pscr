<p>Linus thought of Louis&#39; offer. It was an initially unappealing proposition. He imagined a rather grimy cluttered little hole with a complete lack of sanitation. He looked around uncomfortably in hopes of escape from his currently awkward social situation, but finding none, he turned to the hamster and said, “Louis, I&#39;m afraid that—”
<br><br>
Linus was not allowed to finish his sentence.
<br><br>
“Most excellent, sir! How about at 7:00, then, you shall come over to my house and we shall feast there?”
<br><br>
“Well, I—”
<br><br>
“Of course, naturally! Good day, Linus!” the hamster said spinning off to some distant destination.
<br><br>
Linus let out a sigh of exasperation. He didn&#39;t think that he had ever even told Louis what his name was. He supposed he had an appointment to make, although he wasn&#39;t quite sure why he should feel any more obligated to make one with a talking hamster than any of the numerous humanoid creatures whom he had blown off in the past. There was a problem, though, in that Linus had no idea where the hamster&#39;s hive was located. He shoved the thought aside and guessed he would solve that problem at some later date.
<br><br>
Linus rolled back along the tracks toward Kringel. Kringel picked him up and carried him.
<br><br>
“Any luck, boss?”
<br><br>
“No, Kringel, I&#39;m just a head.”
<br><br>
“Well, you&#39;re better than them, boss.”
<br><br>
“I know I am, Kringel, I know.”
<br><br>
“Ready to wrap up, boss?”
<br><br>
“I think I&#39;ll stay here a while longer, Kringle. You may go.”
<br><br>
Kringle was contractually bound to Linus. It had never happened before that Linus had given him permission to leave, yet Kringle didn&#39;t feel obligated to inquire further, and so left Linus on the floor of the stock exchange.</p>
