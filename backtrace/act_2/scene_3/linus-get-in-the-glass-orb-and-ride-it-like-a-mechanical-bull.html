<p>“Really boss, might you want to get in?”
<br><br>
“Oh, shut it, Kringel. I don&#39;t have time for this nonsense. I have to check the boards.”
<br><br>
“Checking the boards would be a good deal easier if you were in the orb, boss.”
<br><br>
“Shut it, Kringel! Do I look like I enjoy being in that fishbowl?!”
<br><br>
“You don&#39;t look like you particularly like being this close to my armpit, boss.”
<br><br>
Linus fumed a bit, and then said, “Oh, fine then. Put me in.”
<br><br>
Kringel placed Linus in the glass orb. Linus winced a bit as he sensed the mild electric shock from the connector at the base of his neck coming into contact with that at the bottom of the inside of the orb. He felt the electronics power up at the sensing of his biological presence, and he was soon rolling around on the floor of the stock exchange. He maneuvered himself into the strange system of gutter-like structures which crisscrossed the entire inner surface of the building. Linus did not know how he managed to maneuver himself so deftly inside of the hamster ball he was in; he did not care to know. He rode inside, feeling much the same way as when he had chanced to take a mechanical bull or two at the local pub, which is to say, he felt rather nauseous, a feeling which often surprised Linus himself, seeing as to how he was just a head.
<br><br>
The Gutter System was a transportation system spanning the floors, walls, and ceilings of all but the oldest stock exchanges, and no one particularly cared about those remnants from the past anyway. It was generally used as a means of safe and secure information transfer, whereby information was transferred via small, talking hamsters instead of the much quicker, yet vastly more insecure current methods of digital data transfer. Digital data transfer, for most purposes, was perfectly safe. However, the heads of several of the larger Aurelian System Stock Exchange&#39;s companies held rather unhealthy paranoid perspectives on the whole matter of information exchange, and so they used talking hamsters instead of more conventional methods, as talking hamsters had proved to be most unwilling to divulge classified information to unauthorized ears.
<br><br>
Linus decided to take the issue of his business dealings with FutureTech with those in their offices, in person. He rolled his way through the gutter system, passing chattering hamsters on the way who weren&#39;t chattering about anything particularly important. A few of the small rodents recognized Linus and acknowledged him as they passed. Linus scowled back.
<br><br>
Linus rolled into the offices of FutureTech and demanded, “I want to speak to the person in charge of this joint.”
<br><br>
The secretary at the entrance of the FutureTech office looked down at the small object directly in front of his desk.
<br><br>
“So then you want to talk to the head, then?” the secretary asked.
<br><br>
“Yes, I want to talk to the head! What the hell do you think I just told you, dunkass?!”
<br><br>
“Hey, let&#39;s not go around calling people numskulls and such, shall we?” he joked as he rose from his desk to get his manager. Linus shot a burning glare at the secretary, which was mostly lost on the secretary since he had turned his back on Linus. The secretary left his desk and knocked on his boss&#39;s door.
<br><br>
“Come in.” the boss said.
<br><br>
“Sir, I have a head out here.”
<br><br>
“This another of your obscene jokes, Jetrid?”
<br><br>
“Sir, he really is just a head.”
<br><br>
The boss looked up at Jetrid, and he suddenly understood. “Just a head, eh? Well then, can&#39;t keep him waiting, otherwise he might fall behind, no?” The boss rose and walked towards Linus.
<br><br>
“Ah, Mr. Stockstad! What is it that you wish for me to do for you today?”
<br><br>
“Patch me through to Patterson.”
<br><br>
“Patterson? Have you lost your mind as well, Mr. Stockstad?”
<br><br>
“No, I have not lost it, and I&#39;ve never lost anything, dimwit! Now patch me through!”
<br><br>
“Mr. Stockstad, you surely understand that Mrs. Patterson is exceedingly busy during the day. Perhaps if you could call back in—”
<br><br>
“No! I have a multi-million credit deal on the table! I get to talk to Patterson, now!”
<br><br>
“My my, feeling pushy today, are we?”
<br><br>
“Don&#39;t know how he does it since he has no arms.” Jetrid put in.
<br><br>
“GAH! Will you fools listen to me?! I&#39;m your client! You should be trying to keep my business!”
<br><br>
“And you have no body. Well, you want one. And we&#39;re the only game in town that&#39;ll make one as good as you&#39;d like. So you&#39;ll wait to talk to Patterson. And besides, you&#39;re just a head.”
<br><br>
Linus glared at the both of them, and then exited the offices. He was angered by the constant joking at his current state. Those at FutureTech didn&#39;t know, of course, that they were making a very powerful enemy.</p>
