<p>Marlvoch stood on the bridge, scowling. He had no fear of what would happen in the immediate future. He knew the Earthen ships would return to a nearby Allied base, and that he himself would guide the ship to the star system where he was to meet Rujickmoli. He didn&#39;t feel threatened by the fleet of ships that had shown up to protect the cruiser. He felt more on edge about what would happen long term.</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>His plan was merely to test new weapons that had been developed under his command. He didn&#39;t wish for it to be known to any what had happened, yet with the escape of the human and the dwarf, he was forced to acknowledge that people would know what had occurred. He sighed, thinking of his threatened position and threatened plans. He wished he had never followed the scientist&#39;s bidding to keep either of the two, yet he was persuaded by their arguments of how it would be very difficult to develop biological weapons against both of the species if  they hadn&#39;t any to experiment upon. He listened to their constant whining of how one couldn&#39;t find humans on the open market anymore, and he gave in as the wailed of how the dwarf trade had declined to near nothing with the advent of the Inverted Rule 34.0.0 of the Interstellar Association for Biological Trades Regulation. He had given them proper punishment for the trouble they had caused him, and he guessed that they wouldn&#39;t trouble him with their worries much more, even if they ever did manage to profess science again.</p>

<p>Marlvoch looked around. The condition of his crew worried him as well. At this point, all of them were completely naked, and although the Goblin Captain didn&#39;t mind in some cases, he minded more than ever imaginable in others. He supposed it to simply be one more thing to be worked out before Rujickmoli&#39;s coming.</p>
