<p>Marlvoch left the bridge and headed for the kitchen. He did not trust the chefs to properly prepare the the bird. He arrived in there shortly, and looked around at the food being prepared. Or more precisely, he looked at the lack of victual-preparation. The kitchen seemed to be a concentration of general abject laziness. The staff milled around, with nothing to do and nothing to say. A suffocating atmosphere of general inertness hung over the ovens, and the stove seemed swallowed in a pit of dark despair.

“Fowlenztern!” the Goblin Captain shouted in his native tongue. “Why the bloody hell are you just sitting around like this?! You should be working! You! Head chef! What is going on here?!”
<br><br>
“Sire?”
<br><br>
“Yes, you! What is going on?!”
<br><br>
“We&#39;re waiting, sire.”
<br><br>
“For what?!”
<br><br>
“For the next meal, sire.”
<br><br>
“And that&#39;s no more than an hour off!”
<br><br>
“Sire, if I may interject. It is currently half past the seventeenth hour according to the Galactic Time Standard. Taking into account that we –”
<br><br>
“Shut up! You have a meal to prepare! Now get to it, and whoever is responsible for this delay, his head shall be mine!”
<br><br>
“Sire, I received no orders –”
<br><br>
“Why are you still talking, oaf?!”
<br><br>
“Because I prefer my head attached to my shoulders, sire.”

The Goblin Captain glared at the chef. He weighed the option of publicly beheading him for his indolence against the fact that he was probably the only person there with the necessary skills to prepare the gooturibeeducken. He decided it best to keep him for a short while, and execute him after Thornico had left.
<br><br>
“Fine.” the Goblin Captain said. “I don&#39;t care. Just get the gooturibeeducken on the fire, alright? Thornico will be here soon enough.”
