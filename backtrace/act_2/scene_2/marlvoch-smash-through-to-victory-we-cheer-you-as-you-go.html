<p>Marlvoch&#39;s first instinct had been to smash through the human fleet, yet he realized he didn&#39;t have near enough firepower, and to even attempt to do so would be insane. As such, he turned around and fled without so much as a second thought.

<br><br>
“Yes, of course, dumbass! Go! And don&#39;t forget the gooturibeeducken!”
