<p>The Malusine cruiser sailed into port in a normal fashion. After the customary hour long wait for security checks, the occupants of the cruiser disembarked, and went through customs. Claudius disappeared in the frenzy of security sweeps, full body scans, frisks, and metal detecture, as he was apt to do when arriving at a space port. The crew thought nothing of it, and patiently waited through the vast bureaucracy of redundant security and instrumentation tests and checks that had become not only customary, but integral to interstellar travel within Terran controlled systems. Afterwards, Hugo caught up with Frederick and began pestering him about the feast they had scheduled themselves to have upon landing in Beta 7.
<br><br>
“The Culinary District isn&#39;t far from the port.” Hugo shouted to Frederick amidst the noise of port.
<br><br>
“The port itself is rather large.” Frederick shouted back. “We&#39;ll be lucky to make it out of this steaming mass of people without dying from asphyxiation.”
<br><br>
“That&#39;s actually become a real problem in space ports closer to home, you know.”
<br><br>
“Oh?”
<br><br>
“Section (12)( c ) of Bill 4059 of the Constitutional Legislacory, Clause VII. Acknowledgement of poor ventilation in core system commerical ports. Requires upgrade to modern industry standards.”
<br><br>
“&#39;Modern industry standards?”
<br><br>
“Technical details. I could go into it but you would find it boring.”
<br><br>
“Hugo.”
<br><br>
“Yeah.”
<br><br>
“Have you been studying law again.”
<br><br>
Pause.
<br><br>
“A bit.”
<br><br>
The two continued on, and finally came to the ground cars. Frederick hopped the door of the nearest one and took the key from its attendant.
<br><br>
“The nearest vehicle isn&#39;t always the best, Frederick.” Hugo said.
<br><br>
“Worked well enough for me in the past.”
<br><br>
Hugo smiled to himself. Frederick slid the key into the ignition slot and put the car in forward. He pressed his foot to the pedal, and was soon off, bolting down the highway leading out of the space port towards the Culinary District.
<br><br>
“Why&#39;d you disengage the AI?” Hugo asked.
<br><br>
“Want to drive this baby myself.”
<br><br>
“That&#39;s illegal. Section 18 of Bill 2352 explicitly deals with this.”
<br><br>
“Article 17 of Transsystemal Travel and Commerce. International treaties overrule non core local legislature. Ludicrous, but factual.”
<br><br>
Hugo shrugged, again smiling. In a few minutes the two reached the Culinary District. Frederick stepped out and tossed the key to a nearby valet for a local restaurant.
<br><br>
“So this is Beta 7&#39;s famed Culinary Powerhouse.”
<br><br>
Beta 7&#39;s Culinary District was not really a district so much as a small city. In it, every kind of food was available, and everything had a special niche, however small, with some portion of the population. The solids available ranged from the finest gooturibeeducken to the most well executed hamburgers, and the selection of liquids ranged from the effervescent and polyvalent Des Eaux Usées Liquide to the cleanest and purest tapwater to be found within kiloparsecs. All food and drink could be found in Beta 7&#39;s Culinary District. None was left out.
<br><br>
Frederick and Hugo gawked at the selection of grills and chophouses and diners to be selected from.
<br><br>
“Where should we go?” Hugo whispered to Frederick in awe.
