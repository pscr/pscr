“Prepare hyperspace exit.” Claudius&#39; voice boomed.
<br><br>
The crew set about preparing for hyperspace exit. Frederick strapped himself in, and glanced at Hugo. Hugo looked at Frederick, and whispered excitedly, “You ready for some wild gooturibeeducken?”
<br><br>
“Wild subspecies aren&#39;t sentient, correct?”
<br><br>
“What? Of course not, don&#39;t be a fool. Domesticated species haven&#39;t been for some hundreds of years. The group gaining sentience were never even proper gooturibeeducken anyway.”
<br><br>
“That&#39;s debatable, as you know.”
<br><br>
“About as debatable as whether there&#39;s a notable difference between Malusine ships and standard configuration PaxAllis ships.”
<br><br>
“A difference just as clear as the inferiority between SLIX spacecraft design and crossmodus Fenestration teleportation systems.”
<br><br>
“Well, if the hardware had been properly configured to meet the software requirements, you would never have had a problem. Anyway, that glitch saved your—”
<br><br>
“I worked on that thing for over a week. I could never get it to work right.”
<br><br>
“Well, you have to under—”
<br><br>
“I&#39;m not a very good helmsman, you know.”
<br><br>
“Your fine.”
<br><br>
“I know enough to operate the thing on a day to day basis. But in the end, I couldn&#39;t pull through.”
<br><br>
“Come on, Frederick. They got you and your crew through no fault of your own.”
<br><br>
“Through my general incompetence, they died.”
<br><br>
“Frederick, no one could have—”
<br><br>
“Nonsense. It&#39;s been done before. I should have gone into the field, maybe accelerated to the point where I could have swung past it.”
<br><br>
“You followed your captain&#39;s orders. At any rate, that&#39;s what you told all of us, and Claudius believes you, and if Claudius believes you, then it&#39;s pretty much just as good as seeing it your own self.”
<br><br>
“I should have mutinied.”
<br><br>
“Frederick—”
<br><br>
“I should have done it right then and there, at least then we would have had a fighting chance.”
<br><br>
“Frederick &hellip;”
<br><br>
“I could have—”
<br><br>
“FREDERICK.”
<br><br>
Frederick silenced himself. Hugo continued angrily, though in a whisper, much as before.
<br><br>
“No one wants to hear you go on a damn guilt trip about how you didn&#39;t prevent some damned tragedy by following some damnable orders from your superior officer. You did what you were trained to do, and if doing what you were trained to do resulted in your ship going down, that&#39;s the fault of your damned superior officer, not you. Now cheer the hell up or I&#39;m throwing you into the nearest airlock as soon as we make the jump.”
<br><br>
Frederick looked at Hugo blankly, and then pushed himself back into his seat. He sat in silence for a short while, and then said, “I suppose you&#39;re right, Hugo.”
<br><br>
“Of course I&#39;m right, jerkface.” Hugo replied, breaking out into a warm smile. “You ever been to the Beta 7&#39;s Custom&#39;s restaurant hall?
<br><br>
“No. Have you?”
<br><br>
“Nope. Should be interesting.”
<br><br>
“I&#39;m sure.”
<br><br>
This conversation had been conducted at a low enough volume that the crew failed to take notice.
<br><br>
“Ready for jump, captain.” one of the crew shouted.
<br><br>
“Jump.” Claudius replied.
<br><br>
There was a brief jolt, a period of dead silence, and a rather larger jolt. Hyperspace dissolved away to reveal a typical binary system, with five planets orbiting the stars, three of which were gas giants and one of which was a Mercury like planet. The other provided the only hospitable conditions in the system, and then only because modern technology provided corrosion resistant materials capable of holding up under a few hundred atmospheric pressures.
<br><br>
“Binary star systems are so entirely overdone these days.” Frederick commented aloud without realizing it. The crew chuckled a bit.
<br><br>
“Mother nature does what she wishes, Frederick.” Claudius said. “Nothing we can affect or effect.”
<br><br>
“Oh? We&#39;ve learned to terraform planets. Why not whole star systems? Hell, you could make a very profitable business doing that. Think about it, you could set up a company to make planets, and asteroids, and star systems. Fully customizable, suited to your exact needs, wants and purposes. You could probably even order base models out of a catalog and have everything else come as an extension.”
<br><br>
“I think that violates one of the Interstellar Exploration Council&#39;s regulations on promoting open transsystemal investigation.” Hugo commented.
<br><br>
“What? Nonsense. How so?”
<br><br>
“It would cause people to cease seeking out new worlds.”
<br><br>
“Nonsense. How so?”
<br><br>
“Well, I mean, seriously, if you examine the situation, people will stop exploring and simply buy a planet suited to your exact needs and purposes. Decrease in exploration means a violation of some sort of the IEC, no?”
<br><br>
“And those that can&#39;t afford to buy a planet of themselves?”
<br><br>
“They immigrate to Alliance territory in hopes of getting equality funds with which to buy the planet.”
<br><br>
“Equality funding?! That&#39;s ludicrous! Not even we have gone so far as that!”
<br><br>
“It very well could happen. There&#39;s a bill in the legislature concerning the matter.”
<br><br>
“Of equality funding? Goodness.” 
<br><br>
“We&#39;ll be landing shortly, captain.” one of the crew said.
<br><br>
“Very well then,” Claudius replied. “Everyone prepare for landing.”</p>
