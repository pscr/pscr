<p><center>Due to a family medical emergency, I am unable, both emotionally and temporally, to follow the Backtrace update schedule. Therefore, until further notice, Backtrace is on hiatus, such that I have the time to sort through the chaos that has been a result of this emergency, and so that my mind can once again wander unhindered to Frederick, Hugo, Marlvoch, and the rest. My unwillingness and simultaneous incapacity to complete updates are by no means a sign that this literary project is over. As you well know, Timaeus has begun his own book in the Pants Seat Carpet Ride series. Read him, and suggest for him. Keep this alive through his work and your commands.
<br><br>
I shall return. It is merely a question of when.
