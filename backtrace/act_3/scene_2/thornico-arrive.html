<p>Marlvoch waited nervously as the private space liner set down. The mass of gleaming metal held a friend who he hadn&#39;t seen in several years, yet who had somehow managed to remain one of his closest. He fidgeted as the hatch door slowly descended to the ground, and a tall goblin, holding the Sorcerer&#39;s Staff, stepped down.
<br><br>
“Thornico!” Marlvoch called out.
<br><br>
Thornico seemed initially stunned.
<br><br>
“Thornico!” Marlvoch repeated as he walked over to the priest and hugged him close. “I have not seen thee for many a year!”
<br><br>
When Marlvoch drew away, Thornico had a rather bemused look on his face,
<br><br>
“I &hellip; what&#39;s wrong?” Marlvoch asked.
<br><br>
“Ah, Marlvoch. You&#39;re &hellip; attire is &hellip; sparse.”
<br><br>
Marlvoch looked down, aware once more since he had stripped his clothing, that he was completely naked.
<br><br>
“Well, yes. It&#39;s actually become a bit of a fashion thing amongst my crew.”
<br><br>
“I&#39;m a priest, Marlvoch, and thus am bound to celibacy.”
<br><br>
“Well, obviously—”
<br><br>
“Do you know what this is for me, Marlvoch?”
<br><br>
“But you&#39;re—”
<br><br>
“A priest. And I can thus cannot engage in such base activities.”
<br><br>
“Thornico, I know—”
<br><br>
“What were you thinking with me coming? Why do you seek to debase the Holy Mane?”
<br><br>
“But—”
<br><br>
“Why do you tempt me, Marlvoch? What is this evil which you foist upon—”
<br><br>
“You&#39;re asexual!”
<br><br>
Thornico paused, and then broke out into a warm smile. “Marlvoch! I haven&#39;t seen you in ages!” he said, embracing his childhood companion.
<br><br>
“I&#39;ll say.”
“It doesn&#39;t make your nakedness any less disgusting, but at least my priestly duties won&#39;t be jeopardized by this nonsense. You say it has become a fashion thing amongst your crew?”
<br><br>
“Well, yes, it has, actually. They&#39;re all rather devoted to me.”
<br><br>
“Most excellent. How is my friend doing, the one from Kolei?”
<br><br>
“Her? Well, I mean. She&#39;s pretty much the same as she&#39;s always been.”
<br><br>
“Wonderful! I look forward to speaking with her.”
<br><br>
“Would you like that we stop for a meal or two, or that we hop right aboard?” Marlvoch asked.</p>
