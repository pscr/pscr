<p>Thornico and Marlvoch sat next to a fireplace. The two had eaten their evening meal. The gooturibeeducken had been prepared satisfactorily, and Marlvoch hadn&#39;t the need to carry out executions as a result.
<br><br>
“Tell me, Marlvoch. How do you plan to contend with the human?”
<br><br>
“Frederick? I don&#39;t. Why should I? I won&#39;t waste the energy on him.”
<br><br>
“Why did you let him escape, though?”
<br><br>
“I didn&#39;t, actually. He escaped by himself, and through his own ingenuity. He&#39;s a smart kid.”
<br><br>
“That doesn&#39;t worry you?”
<br><br>
“That&#39;s the thing, though. He&#39;s just a kid. He has no reputation. He&#39;s virtually unknown. I&#39;m unworried.”
<br><br>
“He still managed to escape your best fighters, though.”
<br><br>
“Ha! Best fighters! They were idiots. I was glad to be rid of them.”
<br><br>
“Most are idiots, Marlvoch.”
<br><br>
“Yes, our species has a remarkable skew in terms of intellect. It&#39;s quite interesting.”
<br><br>
“So, this Frederick. You aren&#39;t worried of his gumming things up?”
<br><br>
“Why would I be?”
<br><br>
“There&#39;s a particular theme that is extremely prevalent amongst Terran literature. A man, or woman, or child, or whatever, who is extremely unimportant, extremely inconspicuous, becomes a guiding force throughout a story. That is, this person becomes the protagonist, and will eventually complete a hero cycle of some sort or another.”
<br><br>
“I&#39;m not sure I understand what you&#39;re saying. The probabilities are stacked against this runt. And how should a popular Terran literature theme influence objective reality.”
<br><br>
“Mm.”
<br><br>
Marlvoch and Thornico continued to sit and talk.
