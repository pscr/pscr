<p>Thornico braced himself against the impending sight of nudity as he walked onto the bridge. Having been in Marlvoch&#39;s presence for a while at this point, he didn&#39;t find it as distressing as he thought it might have been when he walked onto the bridge, but it was an unaccustomed and unwelcome sight nonetheless.
<br><br>
The ship had entered hyperspace, the eternal flashing lights of the ethereal realm. Thornico wondered at their destination, but could not imagine where they might be going. The lights were slowly brightening, signifying the ships descent into the deeper regions of the vast void, and the Fenestration&#39;s portals were darkening to compensate.
<br><br>
“We&#39;re going rather deep, aren&#39;t we Marlvoch?”
<br><br>
“We are.”
<br><br>
“It&#39;s dangerous here.”
<br><br>
“It is. That&#39;s what makes it so safe.”
<br><br>
“Safe from what?”
<br><br>
“Prying eyes.”
<br><br>
“I suppose you&#39;re right, but even so, there are other remote locations that no one would dare wander to. Why here, in the dangers of hyperspace?”
<br><br>
“Because even so it&#39;s safer. No one&#39;s going to wander out here unless they know we&#39;re here. In other places you have the chance of accidental discovery, you have the possibility of leaving a trail. Here, there is but one trail, and that can be seen by near no one. Do you recognize that frequency, Thornico?” Marlvoch pointed at a display near to the ceiling of the bridge.
<br><br>
“Are you kidding me? Really? How can you even detect that?”
<br><br>
“Quantum Loop Theory has brought us more than just exceptional computing capacities. It also allows for the detection of nanoscopic changes in the quantum spin states of high energy photons. While the signal itself is one which is too high to be detected by even the most advanced instruments, its broadcast does uniquely change the spin states of the photons which it touches, and such changes can be detected, especially in high photon-density environments, —”
<br><br>
“Of which hyperspace is one.” Thornico interrupted. “Right, I know. That&#39;s old news, Marlvoch. It&#39;s been known for the better part of a century.”
<br><br>
“But no one ever decided to test the practical applications. Here&#39;s the thing. High-level hyperspace doesn&#39;t have the photon density for our instrumentation clusters to be able to pick up on the changes to the spin states. But low-level hyperspace does. All we have to do is descend sufficiently far down into hyperspace and we can detect the changes produced by a given broadcast frequency. And then we just follow the photons with altering spin states.”
<br><br>
“That&#39;s &hellip; actually rather clever. I have to admit.”
<br><br>
Pause.
<br><br>
“But still, where are we going?” Thornico asked. “Are you taking me to your headquarters, or what?”
<br><br>
“&#39;Headquarters&#39;? What I&#39;m taking you to isn&#39;t just a headquarters, Thornico. It&#39;s a full blown command station.”
<br><br>
“And how did you get the money to do all this?”
<br><br>
Marlvoch smiled. “Let me keep some secrets, will you?”
<br><br>
“Fine.”
<br><br>
Thornico waited. For a while, nothing happened. An alarm sounded, but Marlvoch didn&#39;t seem concerned.
<br><br>
“Just the proximity alarm.” he said. “Means we&#39;re getting very close.”
<br><br>
“Mmhmm.”
<br><br>
“You see that black dot right there?”
<br><br>
“I can, in spite of the brightness of hyperspace at this depth.”
<br><br>
“That&#39;s it. Everything is there. You&#39;ll see soon enough what I&#39;ve been planning.”
<br><br>
The dot grew as the Fenestration approached it, and details became more apparent. It was a spherical object, roughly the size of Mars, yet about as massive as Earth. It was almost entirely black. The lights of hyperspace did little to illuminate it. Chaotic clusters of long, spiny structures jutted forth from its surface in regular hexagonal formations. The main body of the command center was riveted deep with canyons and valleys, clearly artificial, which were only visible by some strange perspective produced by the lights which guided transport ships away from the walls of the crevices.
<br><br>
“Impressive.” Thornico commented.
<br><br>
“Very much so. It&#39;s been a long time that I&#39;ve waited, slowly amassing what I&#39;ve needed to do what I am doing. And I have at last done it. And we will soon claim what was once ours from the Terrans.”
<br><br>
“And so much more?”
<br><br>
“Yes.” Marlvoch sat. “We will be the Galaxy&#39;s new handlers. We shall have everything. We will win out over the current powers, and they shall die out. Only we shall remain.”
<br><br>
“You sound so confident.”
<br><br>
“But I am. Don&#39;t doubt me, Thornico.”
<br><br>
The ship docked in the command center&#39;s bay with little hassle. Thornico disembarked with Marlvoch and followed him into a nearby elevator. Marlvoch swiped a key card.
<br><br>
“Take us to Hangar 311.” Marlvoch commanded. The elevator stalled a moment, and then burst forth at immeasurable speed towards the hangar. Thornico was knocked to the ground, and Marlvoch, even after his sizable experience riding in the machine, quite nearly lost his balance. When they had reached a constant acceleration Marlvoch reached down and pulled Thornico up.
<br><br>
“You should probably get that fixed.” Thornico commented.
<br><br>
“Eh, I like it that way. It sure makes things interesting.”
<br><br>
“I suppose.”
<br><br>
The elevator stopped and opened. The both of them were in the hangar&#39;s administrative room. Marlvoch took Thornico to a nearby window.
<br><br>
“Woah.” was all Thornico could manage.
<br><br>
Fighter after fighter could be seen, stretching far beyond Thornico could see. They were odd fighters as well, small tentacled ships, not based on any previous Fenestration design as far as Thornico could tell. He thought he saw one move, and he blinked his eyes. Indeed it had moved. One of its flexible extremities lifted up and then slapped down onto the bear concrete floor with startling speed.
<br><br>
“Organic ships. Oldest trick in the book.”
<br><br>
“Except no one, up until now, has managed to find a self-maintaining design.”
<br><br>
“Must be a hassle getting into.”
<br><br>
“Getting into? Try getting out.”
<br><br>
Thornico gave Marlvoch a funny look.
<br><br>
“What&#39;s that supposed to mean.”
<br><br>
“It&#39;s actually no big deal getting in. It&#39;s getting out that&#39;s the issue.”
<br><br>
“But these are production models, not prototypes. Are you not working to rectify that?”
<br><br>
“Certainly not. Why would I? The design is based on implanting a sentient being with a specialized electronic chip, interfacing it with their neural pathways, and then interfacing the chip to a modular AI program which has the capacity to control the ship far better than any unaltered person could, and then hooking the modular AI to a centralized program which has the capacity to send general battle commands to the fighters. It&#39;s actually truly revolutionary.”
<br><br>
“It&#39;ll win its fair share of battles, I&#39;m sure. But what about other ships?”
<br><br>
“Come with me.”
<br><br>
Marlvoch took Thornico back to the elevator, swiped the card once more, and said “Hangar 718.” The same stalling and rapid acceleration that had been experienced last time was felt this time as well. Thornico nearly fell, but managed to keep hold of one of the nearby support bars.
<br><br>
“Here.”
<br><br>
Marlvoch hauled Thornico to the window. Thornico gaped. A veritable array of cruisers stood before him, all of which had similar organic structures. There appeared to be just as many cruisers there as there were fighters in the previous hangar.
<br><br>
“How much did all of this cost?” he asked.
<br><br>
“A tidy sum.”
<br><br>
Marlvoch began to drag Thornico back to the elevator, but Thornico broke free from his grasp.
<br><br>
“Okay, I get the idea. You have more stuff in any one hangar then the entirety of the Cornipian Attack Fleet.”
<br><br>
“Well, in all fairness, Cornipia is kind of in the boondocks of space. They really aren&#39;t that great a power any more.”
<br><br>
“Whatever! I get it! You have a bunch of ships, and you&#39;ll beat the Terrans without issue!”
<br><br>
“One more thing I need to show you.” Marlvoch said, hauling Thornico behind him into the elevator.
<br><br>
“Hangar 530a.” Marlvoch said after having swiped his card yet again. Thornico managed to keep his balance this time.
<br><br>
“Getting the hang of it, I see.” Marlvoch commented.
<br><br>
“Sort of.”
<br><br>
The doors opened, and Thornico walked alongside Marlvoch to the window. The ship in this hangar was huge. Whereas the cruisers had each stretched maybe a a quarter of a mile long and perhaps a tenth of a mile wild, this Thornico couldn&#39;t see either end of this ship.
<br><br>
“This is huge.” he said.
<br><br>
“A planet killer, Thornico, so called for it&#39;s capacity to completely and utterly destroy and entire world.”
<br><br>
“How big is it?”
<br><br>
“It stretches a little over twenty miles length-wise.”
<br><br>
“That&#39;s huge.”
<br><br>
“I know.”
<br><br>
“But I only see one.” Thornico turned, smiling.
<br><br>
“There are others. This is just one. They need to be housed in separate hangars, for obvious reasons. We have a total of eighteen.”
<br><br>
“Just eighteen?”
<br><br>
“My resources aren&#39;t infinite, Thornico.”
<br><br>
“How many hangars are there?”
<br><br>
“817, though not all of them house space-born vehicles. There are a few which are used for weapons storage, a few are actually labs, you get the idea. They&#39;re actually very multi-purpose. You wouldn&#39;t get that from looking at these, though, since they were never built to house anything but warships.”
<br><br>
“This will crush them.”
<br><br>
“It will.”
<br><br>
“But I thought you said my tattling to the Council would have the capacity to destroy all of this.”
<br><br>
“And it would have. Or at least, it would have greatly complicated matters. If you had done so, it would have become known that I do not act under the Council&#39;s authority. This means that they could openly plead all other races in the galaxy to go against me. And in the end, I&#39;m sure many would have done so. But this way, it is possible to first take on the Terrans, who are our greatest problem, and then the other races.”
<br><br>
“What of the defensive pacts that they have with other nations?”
<br><br>
“You mean the ones that are only called into play if they are attacked first? What of them?”
<br><br>
“But it&#39;s rather obvious at this point that you did attack first.”
<br><br>
“At this point. But later? Not so much.”
<br><br>
“How are you going to convince everyone otherwise.”
<br><br>
“I have it figured out, don&#39;t worry.”
<br><br>
Thornico turned back to the ship before him.
<br><br>
“When do we start?”
<br><br>
“As soon as we are at war.”</p>
