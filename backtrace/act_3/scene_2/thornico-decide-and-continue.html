<p>“I think it would be best were we to go right ahead.” Thornico replied. “I&#39;ve already eaten, and I care not for airports.”
<br><br>
“Quite.” Marlvoch replied, motioning towards his ship and walking towards it.
<br><br>
The two boarded Marlvoch&#39;s ship. Although Marlvoch was pleased to see Thornico once more, he felt a certain amount of tension from him, as though he was preoccupied with some important matter. Marlvoch took him to his quarters. The low hum of the ship&#39;s motors began, and there were a few jolts as it ascended into the air. Marlvoch smiled as he opened the door. He was glad to be master of such a ship.
<br><br>
“These are your rooms.” Marlvoch said. “I hope you find them satisfactory.”
<br><br>
“They&#39;re fine.”
<br><br>
“Are you fine? You seem rather beatdown.”
<br><br>
“I am. I must confess, though, that I am not here merely to visit, Marlvoch. I come because I have important matters to discuss with you.”
<br><br>
“Oh?”
<br><br>
“They concern a certain incident that happened some hours ago. Something with regard to a wrecked Terran patrol?”
<br><br>
Marlvoch rolled his eyes.
<br><br>
“What, did our Grand High President send you on some mission to get me to divulge information?”
<br><br>
“Yes, he did, actually. In person.”
<br><br>
“In person? I suppose this is something considered to be very important then.”
<br><br>
“Anything concerning political relations with the Terrans is something to be taken very seriously. Especially if worse relations could be a possible result.”
<br><br>
“Let&#39;s take this elsewhere.”
<br><br>
“Where else would we go? If we went to one of the rooms with so called &#39;cloaking technology&#39;, I would most certainly have the capacity to evade such technologies through the use of my priestly powers. Sorcery trumps science nearly every time, Marlvoch.”
<br><br>
“So now you&#39;re violating my privacy.”
<br><br>
“Note that I never said that our conversation was or is being recorded.”
<br><br>
“Thornico, please, I really don&#39;t want to go into this right now.”
<br><br>
“Neither do I. Yet it is my duty, and it is your complementary duty to go into it with me.”
<br><br>
“It can&#39;t wait till we&#39;ve at least gotten into hyperspace?”
<br><br>
“We&#39;ll be there a few minutes regardless. What potential use would it be to be in hyperspace before you told me? Now you&#39;re just needlessly stalling.”
<br><br>
“Why did they send you here?”
<br><br>
“To get information, obviously.”
<br><br>
“No, but why you.”
<br><br>
“Because I was known to be one of your closest companions. I&#39;ve also proven myself to be rather loyal to the Republic. And I&#39;ve had a history of getting much needed information in the past. I was the best of all possible worlds.”
<br><br>
“I can&#39;t believe this.” Marlvoch said turning around to face a mirror. “They sent my best friend to spy on me.”
<br><br>
“Not to spy, precisely, but I suppose in essence, yes.”
<br><br>
“I can&#39;t delay this, can I?”
<br><br>
“Not really.”
<br><br>
Pause.
<br><br>
“Alright, so how much do you know?” Marlvoch asked.
<br><br>
“I know as much about the matter as anyone is to know. You destroyed a Terran patrol ship without provocation.”
<br><br>
“I destroyed a Terran patrol ship, yes. Without provocation? I would hardly go that far.”
<br><br>
“Why did you destroy it then?”
<br><br>
“For reasons I can&#39;t tell you.”
<br><br>
“Come now Marlvoch. I need to know, and you need me to know.”
<br><br>
“But you don&#39;t need to know, that&#39;s thing.”
<br><br>
“Marlvoch, you&#39;ve served for more than twenty years. That&#39;s a long time, and you have the rank to show it is a long time. The people in power are doing their best to protect you, and part of that is because of how much you have given us. But it will only serve you so far.”
<br><br>
“Those in power are weak. They&#39;re cowards. They haven&#39;t the guts to go through with anything.”
<br><br>
“That may be. But that doesn&#39;t excuse treachery, treason, and insubordination.”
<br><br>
Marlvoch turned and looked Thornico in the eye.
<br><br>
“Are you saying I&#39;m a felon?”
<br><br>
“You very well may be. All the evidence supports such a thesis. I&#39;m here to see whether or not you have anything suggesting otherwise.”
<br><br>
Marlvoch was silent.
<br><br>
“Marlvoch, we can either sit here, and you can say nothing. I will then head back to headquarters, where I will be forced to report that you gave no evidence to support any theory of self-defense or something of that sort concerning this whole event, and that you even admitted that you destroyed the patrol. You will be forced to resign your position at best, and you will be given a court-martial, tried for treason, and given the Gallows Calibration at worst. Or, instead, you can tell me what happened, your motivation, and I can go back with a denial in hand. A denial from someone as venerable as you would mean something, and regardless of your intentions, it would almost certainly guarantee, at worst, a public denouncement of your acts and character.”
<br><br>
“Why can&#39;t you see for yourself what is, with your sorcerer&#39;s powers?”
<br><br>
“Because I am not an omniscient being, I never have been, I never will be, and I can&#39;t get knowledge on demand. There are certain things which I can see, and others I cannot. You know this. Simply tell me why. That&#39;s all I ask really.”
<br><br>
“Thornico.” Marlvoch sighed. Pause. “You know why? You want to know why I blew up that ship? You want to know why I destroyed a Terran patrol? Because I want to make the Republic great again. We were great before the Terrans, and in dealing with them we lost our greatness. The time has come that they pay for their past crimes, and we reclaim our place as the galaxy&#39;s greatest power.”
<br><br>
“And destroying a simple patrol ship will be sufficient to restore out greatness?”
<br><br>
Marlvoch smiled.
<br><br>
“No. Not simply. Destroying the ship was merely a beginning.”
<br><br>
“Of what? War?”
<br><br>
“That would seem the most natural explanation, yes?”
<br><br>
“And how do you hope that war would permit us to become great again?”
<br><br>
“We would wipe from existence those who oppose us.”
<br><br>
“And how would we do that? We are weaker than they.”
<br><br>
“I have plans.”
<br><br>
“Obviously. And I&#39;m asking what those plans are.”
<br><br>
“Care to join me on the bridge?”
<br><br>
“Why?”
<br><br>
“To show you exactly what my plans are.”
<br><br>
“You have that face where you think you&#39;re about to strike a deal with someone.”
<br><br>
“Do I? Maybe that&#39;s because I do hope to strike a deal, actually.”
<br><br>
“What sort of a deal?”
<br><br>
“You join me. In return, you have knowledge.”
<br><br>
“Such knowledge will only go to the Council.”
<br><br>
“So what if it does? My plans are already in motion. Nothing they can say or do can prevent me now.”
<br><br>
“So what you&#39;re saying is that no matter what I do, we end up at war with the Terrans, and we crush them?”
<br><br>
“Yes.”
<br><br>
“So then what does it matter if I join you or not? You shall succeed in either case.”
<br><br>
“Perhaps because we&#39;re old friends, and I don&#39;t want to leave you out. If you agree to join me, you shall have knowledge of how I will accomplish what I will. If you don&#39;t, you shall have no such knowledge.”
<br><br>
“Marlvoch, my superiors would not be pleased.”
<br><br>
“To hell with your superiors! Listen, I am giving you the opportunity to serve at the right hand of greatness, and you&#39;re simply wasting it! Is this really what you want?”
<br><br>
“Do I detect mutiny and rebellion?”
<br><br>
“Yes, but not merely for the sake of mutiny and rebellion.”
<br><br>
“But rather for the sake of making the Republic great.”
<br><br>
“Exactly.”
<br><br>
“Blah blah blah, Marlvoch. I have an obligation to serve my superiors, just as you do. The obligation transcends my individual wants and needs for the sake of fulfilling some greater need. And it is a free choice of ours to give up our own wants and needs for the service of this greater need.”
<br><br>
“And that need I pledged to fulfill when I was first initiated into the military was to &#39;serve our republic and our people, for the greater glory of the Republic, from here on unto death&#39;. Don&#39;t you see that&#39;s what I&#39;m saying? I&#39;m not some maniac bent on control of the entire galaxy. Hell, I don&#39;t want control of the entire galaxy. But I do will the greater glory of the Republic. That is all I seek by doing what I am doing.”
<br><br>
“And so by pledging to the &#39;greater glory&#39;, we now have an obligation to perform monstrous acts in order to fulfill this greater glory?”
<br><br>
“But they aren&#39;t monstrous! They are just!”
<br><br>
“How so?”
<br><br>
“I just told you! For one, we were wronged! Retaliation is justified! And then, what I do shall make us a great nation! I pledged my life to making us great, and I will make us great! Now are you with me?”
<br><br>
“I feel an odd sense of irony, actually. Almost as if some Terran thought the same once of the will in relation to annihilation.”
<br><br>
“Thornico. I will do what I will do. You cannot prevent me. Now are you with me?”
<br><br>
Thornico thought.
<br><br>
“I am with you. On one condition. You tell me some things I want to know.”
<br><br>
“What?”
<br><br>
“Would your plans have been ruined were I to have gone back to the Council with this information?”
<br><br>
Pause, then slight laughter from Marlvoch.
<br><br>
“Probably.”
<br><br>
“I thought as much.”
<br><br>
Pause.
<br><br>
“How is it that I can&#39;t read you today?” Thornico asked.
<br><br>
“What do you mean?”
<br><br>
“I can&#39;t read you, your intent, your will, nearly as easily as I once was. It&#39;s all rather blurry.”
<br><br>
“The Oracle of Kolei isn&#39;t completely useless then.”
<br><br>
Pause.
<br><br>
“Want to see what I have planned now?” Marlvoch asked.
<br><br>
“Why don&#39;t we.”
<br><br>
“One thing though,” Marlvoch said as he stood in the doorway, facing back in towards Thornico. “Was that conversation recorded or tapped?”
<br><br>
“It was recorded, but was untapped. But then, what use is the recording now? No need to worry, it will never make its way to the Council.”
<br><br>
The two exited the quarters and walked towards the bridge.</p>
