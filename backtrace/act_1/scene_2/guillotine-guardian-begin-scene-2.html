“What the bloody hell is going on?!” the goblin captain demanded of the small figure seated before him.
<br><br>
“Be damned if I told you.” the dwarf replied.
<br><br>
The captain struck the figure across the face, his insignia ring ripping into the obstinate individual&#39;s cheek. Although thick blood slowly made its way down the dwarf&#39;s face, he showed little emotional or physical pain from the blow. The goblin captain uttered some phrase of sorcery that was almost certainly meant to unbind the dwarf&#39;s clamped jaws. The dwarf simply hiked up one of his eyebrows in response, puzzled by the captain&#39;s use of foul language.

“Take him to the torturers.” the captain commanded, sighing heavily as he did so. The dwarf got up congenially from his sitting position and walked in front of the guards on his way to the torturers. He held his head high, and maintained all manner of his dignity. The goblin captain sneered at this expression of pride on the part of the dwarf. He despised the dwarves and their haughty countenance. He wished he could simply wipe them from the universe, and indeed, he was conspiring to do so. Soon, the goblins would be the only race in the universe.</p>
