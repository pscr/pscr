<p>Marlvoch stood, stretching out his arms in elation towards the ceiling above him. He burst out his door, screaming, running down the corridors like a madman. His neck clasp loosened and flew off its usual post. A crack in the air could be heard several yards in front of him, as his shirt was rent and torn to shreds. The buckle of his belt sprang free, and soon Marlvoch was clad in nothing but a pair of loose briefs. These too had no trouble in releasing themselves from the captain&#39;s body.
<br><br>
He sang for joy as he rushed about the ship, the cool wind beating against his bare skin. A pair of twin goblin sisters happened to see him running through the hall ways.
<br><br>
“Ooh, look at the captain!” one said to another. “Completely in the nude (a ha)!”
<br><br>
“Oh, hush you!” the other replied, observing her garments. The first observed this observation of the second, saying, “Say, you aren&#39;t thinking &hellip; .”
<br><br>
“Oh, totally!” the second replied.
<br><br>
The two, each having a rather large stake in the goblin fashion industry, and both seeing the potential in this new style of clothing, stripped.
<br><br>

<br>
Marlvoch continued on his path. His friend was coming. He burst onto the bridge in dramatic fashion.
<br><br>
“Friends, countrymen!” the Goblin Captain bellowed. “I have an announcement to make!”
<br><br>
The crew looked at the captain, and then around at each other, rather shocked by the image of their leader in the buff. Few, if any, could truly focus on what he was saying, and those that could in all likelihood chose not to.
<br><br>
“A few of those here have had the privilege to meet my good friend, Thornico Rujickmoli! Many of you shall vouch for the pleasure that he brings to any party! Not so, Kriaoma?”
<br><br>
The Goblin Captain turned to one of the crew, waiting for her to respond. Kriaoma snapped out of her dreamy stupor. “Huh? Oh, yes, Rujickmoli. Yes. Fine fellow. Yes. Um &hellip; yeah.”
<br><br>
“You have heard your fellow member&#39;s testimony!” the Goblin Captain shouted, gesturing in a most extraordinary fashion. “I tell you, this man, this great lump of Goblin Pride, Thornico, shall be boarding this ship! Let us ready ourselves to welcome him!”
<br><br>
The crew remained in a state of suspended animation.
<br><br>
“Well?!” Marlvoch roared. “Get to it! Ready yourselves!”
<br><br>
“Um, Captain?” a young man in the back questioned, trying his best to ignore the present circumstances.
<br><br>
“Yes &hellip; ?” Marlvoch replied tentatively.
<br><br>
“How precisely do you wish that we should prepare for Master Rujickmoli&#39;s coming?”
<br><br>
“How should I know?! Gather food! Prepare a feast! Invite the entire ship! Even invite that damed oracle if you like! And most importantly, ferret out the human! Dress yourselves finely! Bring drink and merriment! I don&#39;t know, you through a party for me once, and it was a bloody lot of fun! Do whatever you did last time!”
<br><br>
“The human has severed himself from the rest of the ship quite effectively, sir.” another said. “We don&#39;t have the capacity to unlock the doors.”
<br><br>
“Then use explosives, you jackasses! <em>Think</em>! Now get busy!”
<br><br>
All the crew members present except for those guiding the most critical system operations immediately left, performing the bidding of the naked goblin captain. Marlvoch noted that some of those who stayed behind were beginning to loosen their neck clasps and dispense with the upper parts of their uniforms. Marlvoch left before he saw much else.
