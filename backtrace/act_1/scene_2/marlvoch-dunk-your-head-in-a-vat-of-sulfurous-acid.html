<p>Marlvoch started towards his quarters, storming his way through the ship&#39;s narrow corridors. He was tired, stressed from the day&#39;s experiences, and felt that he didn&#39;t quite have much control over his life. This feeling rather annoyed him, especially considering that it was this very sense of powerlessness within him that he was attempting to rid himself of. The very thought of someone or something having the capacity to control his life angered him greatly. He beat against the steel walls of the corridor with his fist, the unyielding outcroppings of his knuckles scratching the walls, producing a most terrifying screech, the intolerable sound of bone against metal.
<br><br>
He pushed aside the guards standing in front of his quarters and went in, gazing around at the cluttered mess that was his living room. He pushed a chair out of his way, heading straight for the chemical room. He took out some of his bath crystals, and, putting them in a bucket of water that he reserved for such purposes as these, managed to produce a rather large quantity of sulfurous acid. He took off his headband and proceeded to plunge his head into the liquid. He relaxed as the acid slowly dissolved away the soil and sweat he had accrued from the day&#39;s experiences, passing on like sand tossed in the sea. He felt a slight sting as the fluid revolved its way around a slight scrape he had received earlier that day, but that pain too faded. The sulfite solution, with a similar acidity as Earthen lemon juice, permeated the Goblin Captain&#39;s hair, prying away the dust and grime from its most natural habitat.
<br><br>
Marlvoch lifted his head out of the small vat, grabbing a towel with which to dry himself off. The doorbell to his apartment buzzed.
<br><br>
“Yes?” Marlvoch asked of the porter sent to him, peering from behind his door.
<br><br>
“Master Rujickmoli commanded me to give you this ahead of him.”
<br><br>
Marlvoch took the small envelope, closing the door behind him. Rujickmoli. He had hardly spoken to him in over a year and a half. He eagerly pried forth the letter from its packaging, and read quickly what his old friend had to say:
<br><br><br>
<em>My Dear Friend, Marlvoch:
<br><br>
It has been to long since we have spoken. I have thought of thee often in the days gone past, remembering the times of olde, when we would do near everything in each other&#39;s company. Dost thou recollect those good times we had, each in the presence of the other?
<br><br>
Providence so happened to make it a matter of destiny, that I should be in the same region of space as thou at this time. I have, as such, taken the liberty, knowing that thou wouldst not be displeased, to invite myself over to thine vessel. If such is perchance not readily feasible, than I wouldst of course pardon thee frome thine obligation as host, and let thee have thine way. Contact me in a most immediate fashion if it undesirable that I should pay my dear friend a visit.</em>
<br><br>
[Signed]<br>
<em>Thornico Rujickmoli</em>
<br><br>
<em>P.S. I do beg thine pardone for mine own “slip-ups”, if you will, in this deadest tongue. If thou knowest me, than thou shalt see, the humour granted to all here as to the irony with which I write these very words.</em>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Marlvoch laughed at the short note that he had received. From first glance, it did not appear humourus at all, but rather markedly upsetting, near blasphemous, for Rujickmoli was mistreating, misusing, and mocking the sacred tongue. Marlvoch knew Rujickmoli well, however, and knew that his affectionate parody of the Sacred Tongue was rather a celebration of the language&#39;s glory.
<br><br>
Marlvoch near cried he was so filled with joy.</p>
