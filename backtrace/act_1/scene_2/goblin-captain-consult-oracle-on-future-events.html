<p>The Goblin Captain looked out over the wide vista of space before him. Clean clear walls, standard on all but the most stripped down Fenestrations, gave him a perspective of the vast open space upon which he looked that was unparalleled by any other model of ship. There was a great deal of uncertainty in his plans, yet looking out into space, he was confident in their success.
<br/><br/>
The Goblin Captain left the bridge, walking with due expediency to the Chambers of the Oracle. He bought a few rare animals and exotic herbs along the way to sacrifice to the gods providing the oracle with wisdom, as was common practice for one truly thirsting for knowledge. As he walked into the chambers, the putrid stench of sacrifices long passed hit his face. He was well acquainted with the Oracle of Kolei at this point, having relied on her for many instances when he was in need of advice. He felt that she was a con-artist, possibly unable to fulfill her capacities as an oracle, probably unwilling to do so even if she was able. Nevertheless, a corrupt and unreliable oracle was better than none.
<br/><br/>
“Marlvoch Tyronnus Seption, Soon-to-be-Ruler of the Vast Expanses of the Unholy Universe,” the oracle said in her husky, near-masculine voice, “you have approached the Most Holy Grand High Prophetic Oracle of Kolei with Great Intended purpose. What is that purpose if which you seek fulfillment?”
<br/><br/>
The Goblin Captain nearly lost his previous meal with disgust for the reification of the Oracular Rituals that was always the result of speaking with the Oracle of Kolei. For one thing, he had repeatedly told the Oracle, and all the rest of the crew for that matter, that he was not to be referred to by that title. For another, he knew that the oracle before him was not at all Grand, and the only point at which she was High was when she was in the company of other oracular individuals who had brought a large quantity of the region’s finest herbs along with them with which the entire party might seek to entertain itself. It seemed also that only when she was High was she at all Prophetic, and due to the high price of certain species of shrubbery within the galaxy, she entered a truly prophetic state very rarely. A myriad of other minor offenses made themselves apparent, yet Marlvoch none the less managed to swallow his disgust and reply in the set forth fashion.
<br/><br/>
“Oh Most Great and Holy Oracle,” Marlvoch began, “you who channels the Most High and Noble Powers of the Elder Gods, you whose eyes are open where others are blind, I have come to beg of you knowledge of what has not yet come to pass.”
<br/><br/>
“And what is this knowledge which you seek?”
<br/><br/>
“Great Oracle, tell me, what shall be the outcome of my Most Holy Quest?”
<br/><br/>
“Approach with thine offerings, that thine future might be revealed to thee.”
<br/><br/>
Marlvoch was taken slightly off guard. The Rules of Oraclation were built in such a manner as to discourage the offering of sacrifice before the Oracle replied. Only in cases where great thought and pleading to the deities was required was it acceptable to present sacrifice before a response was given. Marlvoch thought this over, and realized that perhaps the Oracle was alluding to some characteristic of his quest that he did not think she would acknowledge. With this in mind, he stepped forward gingerly and laid the sacrifices out upon the altar.
<br/><br/>
The Oracle seemed well pleased enough. <em>And by rights she should be</em>, Marlvoch thought. <em>Those delicacies cost me more than I would normally give for</em> her <em>advice</em>.
<br/><br/>
A cleaver was raised high above the head of the Oracle, the blade gleaming strongly in the light cast upon her. It came down with startling swiftness, and the head of the first of the rabbit-like creatures was separated from its normal resting place. A second and third plunge of the blade permanently silenced the other two of the creatures. The Oracle at once commenced to feast upon these recently deceased animals, seasoned with the subtle tastes and aromas of cinnamon and nutmeg. The Oracle made then as though this banquet allowed for heightened levels of perception, for greater power in prescience.
<br/><br/>
“Thine greatest &hellip; am, nom &hellip; enemy &hellip; mm, om nom &hellip; shall &hellip; mm &hellip; under &hellip; am nom, om, guf, aoh, nom om &hellip; shall &hellip; mm &hellip; under any circumstance &hellip; om, mm &hellip; fall.”
<br/><br/>
The Goblin Captain waited a moment for the Oracle to say more, but she seemed to be occupied solely on the meal set before her. A rather loud spewing of gas, oddly warm and resonant for a female member of the goblin species, was emitted from the Oracle front orifice.
<br/><br/>
“Well?” Marlvoch asked of the Oracle.
<br/><br/>
“Mm &hellip; ? Oh &hellip; om &hellip; naw &hellip; that&#39;s all I got for you kiddo &hellip; oom, om nom &hellip; . &#39;orry &hellip; mm, nom om nom.”
<br/><br/>
Marlvoch waited a moment and then left. The Oracle of Kolei had proved most useless to him.</p>
