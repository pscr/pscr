<p>The human and the dwarf sat in silence. Gomwell was the first to break it.

“You smell faintly of carbonic acid.” he said.
<br><br>
“One of our organic computing modules busted before the ship went down.” Frederick replied.
<br><br>
“Ah.”
<br><br>
Another stretch of silence ensued.
<br><br>
“How&#39;d you end up on that dump?” asked Gomwell.
<br><br>
“We were attacked by goblins unexpectedly. A hardware glitch in our ship gave rise to my being teleported to the bridge of the goblin ship.”
<br><br>
“You weren&#39;t in a Fenestration?”
<br><br>
“Crossmodus. Result of the Fenestration fighting the PaxAliis. It occasionally makes bigger trouble than the transition would otherwise be worth.”
<br><br>
“Ah.”
<br><br>
“And the goblins keep their teleportation technology to themselves. The Fenestration commercially available have lesser capacities and reliability.”
<br><br>
Pause.
<br><br>
“Why&#39;d they attack you?”
<br><br>
“Don&#39;t know.”
<br><br>
Pause.
<br><br>
“What happened to you?” asked Frederick.
<br><br>
“They attacked us. The call went out to abandon ship. I was the only one that actually made it out of the wreck. They picked up my escape pod and put me in a cell.”
<br><br>
“Ah.”
<br><br>
Pause.
<br><br>
“How are you not dead already?” asked Frederick.
<br><br>
“Dwarfish blood is thick. And anyway, it&#39;s only a flesh wound.”
<br><br>
“Huh.”
<br><br>
Pause.
<br><br>
“You religious?” asked Gomwell.
<br><br>
“Not particularly.”
<br><br>
Pause.
<br><br>
“You?”
<br><br>
“What?”
<br><br>
“Are you?”
<br><br>
“Am I what?”
<br><br>
“Religious.”
<br><br>
“Not really. Why?”
<br><br>
“Just curious.”
<br><br>
Pause.
<br><br>
“Maybe you are a Hobbes.”
<br><br>
“Huh?”
<br><br>
“Not religious.”
<br><br>
“What?”
<br><br>
“Never mind.”

“Long ride, eh?”
<br><br>
“Hmm.”
<br><br>
Pause.
<br><br>
“Think we&#39;ll get rescued soon?”
<br><br>
“Not likely.”
<br><br>
Pause.
<br><br>
“Think we&#39;ll get rescued?”
<br><br>
Pause.
<br><br>
“Frederick?”
<br><br>
Pause.
<br><br>
“Perhaps, Gomwell.”
<br><br>
Silence.
