Frederick Hobbes reclined in the comfortable executive chair that he had claimed by right of conquest. He hated goblins, but he had to admit, they had taste. They had outfitted the control room to the top. <em>Doz Tzichmmerch</em>, as the goblins would be apt to call such a place, was so comfortable and enjoyable, if, of course, you didn&#39;t mind the bugs that would occasionally creep out from the darkest corners of the room. Frederick noted one at the present moment, nodded to it, and then proceeded to strike it dead with the heel of his boot, one of the many articles of clothing that he had managed to teleport into the room from their holding cells deep within the goblin ship. <em>That makes twenty-one</em>, he thought with a hint of irony. <em>Vingt-et-un. I rake in double my stake.</em>
<br><br>
Frederick glanced at the terminal display. The files had nearly finished copying themselves to the flash card. It had taken him a good deal of time to search through the data on the ship&#39;s mainframe to find any sensitive data, and then a fair deal of hacking had been involved in actually getting access to the files. He was prepared for a similar struggle in his attempt to gain write permissions to the files, in order that he might be able to wipe the sensitive data, even though it was probably saved on several remote servers dispersed throughout the Goblin Empire.
<br><br>
Frederick pondered. He wished to know precisely why such data had been kept on this particular ship. He rather doubted that the captain of the vessel didn&#39;t know of its presence. It simply wasn&#39;t like the goblins to hide data on a ship without the knowledge of the head of the ship. Yet if the data had been put there with the captain&#39;s knowledge, than it would surely relate to some mission that the captain was to carry our. The data related to something vastly beyond the scope of that with which any ordinary captain of any ordinary Fenestration would be concerned.
<br><br>
Another puzzling thing was the order from the captain&#39;s superior commanding him to attack Frederick&#39;s ship. Or rather, the <em>lack</em> of any such order was puzzling. The goblins usually communicated battle orders that were saved (in a relatively secure fashion) to the mainframe of the ship to carry the orders out. Frederick had found no such file, which meant that the orders were set to self erase a few minutes after reception, suggesting that the goblins attached significant importance to the ship Frederick was on. Yet his ship had been a simple border patrol ship. The goblins would have no reason to attack it.
<br><br>
Frederick noted the sound of scampering feet outside the hall door of the turbine control room. He turned slowly to the door, and realized, in a flash of omniscience, that the goblins intended to blow a hole through it. He readied his contraband energy weapon, and braced himself for the impact.
<br><br>
The charge went off, and the door collapsed on the floor in front of him, a small cloud of smoke wafting away from the frame. A group of three goblins jumped in the door. Frederick, for a fraction of a second, was rather surprised, as he noted that two of them were completely naked. This did not leave him permanently disabled, however, and having regained that tiny bit of his composure which he had lost, he launched an attack against these Creatures in the Buff.
<br><br>
Frederick shot twice at them, yet a force field prevented him from being able to kill them with his crude weapon. As such, he fell onto his capacities as a martial artist to deliver himself from the present situation. One of the goblins had fired at him, but Frederick managed to evade the projectile. He ran up the wall, and, using the ceiling itself as a pushing off point, managed to land a kick square in the face of one of the goblins. A roundhouse to the sensitive areas incapacitated another on a semi-permanent basis, and a swipe of the leg landed the third goblin flat on his face.
<br><br>
Frederick smiled at himself. Who was he kidding? He hadn&#39;t got past yellow belt when he studied the techniques of hand-to-hand combat under some of Earth&#39;s allegedly “Great Minds of the Art of Fight”. The suit he had underneath his uniform knew a fair deal about the whole process, though, and backed up that knowledge with near hydraulic strength.
<br><br>
Frederick made good an opportunity to escape, not wishing to overextend his stay at the control room. He grabbed the flash card and hit ENTER on the computer&#39;s keyboard. He was suddenly transported into the docking bay of the goblin ship.</p>
