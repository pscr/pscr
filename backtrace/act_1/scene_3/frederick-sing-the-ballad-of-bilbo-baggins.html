<p>Frederick felt incredibly proud of himself, feeling as though he had just snatched the treasure from under the dragon&#39;s nose. He paused to think a moment, and then continued walking on, singing a tune of old to himself:
<br><br><center>
<em>In the middle of the earth in the land of the Shire<br>
Lives a brave little hobbit whom we all admire.<br>
With his long wooden pipe,<br>
Fuzzy, woolly toes,<br>
He lives in a hobbit hole &hellip;</em>
</center><br><br>
Frederick paused another moment, realizing that by singing the piece aloud he was actually breaking Earthen copyright law rather flagrantly. He remembered the passing of a particular law, stating that it was strictly prohibited for any man to under any circumstances reproduce the work of an artist without the express written permission of said artist. Given that the Ballad was written several hundred years before the passing of this particular law, the author probably hadn&#39;t had the foresight to write any releases from for the law, saying that it was alright to reproduce the song under certain narrow circumstances. Therefore, Frederick&#39;s reproduction of the number was most likely illegal, meaning he would near certainly be sued by the state on the behalf of Mr. Nimoy were anyone to catch him. Such thoughts nearly caused him to stop, in fact, but Frederick had been struck by the utter stupidity of the law at the time of its inception, and so he thought better of stopping, and continued singing anyway.
<br><br><center>
<em>Bilbo (Bilbo)<br>
Bilbo Baggins<br>
The bravest little hobbit of them all<br>
<br>
Now hobbits are peace-lovin&#39; folks you know<br>
They don&#39;t like to hurry and they take things slow<br>
They don&#39;t like to travel away from home<br>
They just want to eat and be left alone<br>
But one day Bilbo was —</em>
</center><br><br>
“Haven&#39;t heard that one in a long time.” a gruff voice stated.
<br><br>
Frederick whirled with his pistol-like weapon, facing the source of the voice.
<br><br>
“<em>You</em> again?” Frederick asked.
<br><br>
“What, unhappy to see me?” the dwarf responded.
<br><br>
“Well, no, just surprised. You don&#39;t seem to be doing that well.”
<br><br>
“No, good sir, I am not doing at all well. I am limping from this wound here caused by the insertion of a blunt object into the middle part of my right leg during the middle of my attempt to abscond! You think I should be doing <em>anything</em> at this point?!”
<br><br>
“Well, I suppose not.”
<br><br>
The pitter-patter of naked goblin feet made its way across the vast distance between two points on the ship. The wrath of an irate goblin captain was being ushered along by scores of underlings to the dwarf and the human. The human, seeing his new friend in distress, and knowing that he would not last even the short walk to the nearest fighter, swept to him and lifted him, speeding forth at inhuman speed towards the fighter wing. <em>Is there anything this suit cannot do?</em> Frederick asked himself.
<br><br>
Frederick saw the open fighter and hopped in quickly, delivering the dwarf to the cavern behind the pilot&#39;s seat. He hot-wired the ignition, and fired up the engines. The fighter slowly pulled away from the dock as Frederick wired the Goblin Captain. He got Communications instead.
<br><br>
“Hello?”
<br><br>
“Gimme the Captain.”
<br><br>
“Who is this?”
<br><br>
“It&#39;s the dude that&#39;s about to blow this whole damn rig up. Just give me the Captain.”
<br><br>
The communications person seemed adequately scared by this threat, and she didn&#39;t need a whole lot of convincing considering the past few hours, what with both the human and the dwarf in store having managed to escape twice. She handed the speaker over to the Goblin Captain, attempting to explain to him the exact nature of the call.
<br><br>
“Where the hell are you, you human creep?! I know it&#39;s you!”
<br><br>
“Well then, Captain, no need to get our feathers ruffled over the matter. Just thought I&#39;d let you know I&#39;m about to cause some serious excrement to hit the fan right now unless you open those docking bay doors.”
<br><br>
“You&#39;re in a fighter. Talking to me. Threatening to <em>blow me up</em>.”
<br><br>
“Your point being?”
<br><br>
“You are a disgusting being!”
<br><br>
“Hey, I wasn&#39;t the one who attacked a patrol ship in the middle of peacetime, okay? You don&#39;t blame me —”
<br><br>
“Shut the hell up! You don&#39;t know the first thing about that!”
<br><br>
“Okay, just like I said, don&#39;t lose your cool over this. I&#39;m asking for a really rather simple thing here.”
<br><br>
“You&#39;re asking me to just let you go.”
<br><br>
“What&#39;s so bad about that?”
<br><br>
A rather long silence ensued, after which the Goblin Captain said, “Okay, fine, I&#39;ll open the doors.”
<br><br>
“Like a sir?” asked Frederick. The Captain terminated the call before Frederick could finish his question.
<br><br>
The desired effect resulted from this call, however. The docking bay doors opened, and Frederick sped out full throttle. Other fighters started exiting the docking bay about half a minute later, tailing Frederick from a far distance, readying their weapons to fire upon him once they had closed the gap between the two parties.
<br><br>
“Looks like you have a following.” the dwarf commented to Frederick.
<br><br>
“Ha!” Frederick laughed back arrogantly. “Sure as hell better, cause I am the stuff.”
<br><br>
“Shouldn&#39;t we be worried about them?”
<br><br>
“Nah, I&#39;ve a little surprise in store for them.”
<br><br>
“Their engines are burning bright.”
<br><br>
“Oh? Well, I guess that just means a lesser boom.”
<br><br>
“What kind of a surprise, exactly?”
<br><br>
“Explosives.”
<br><br>
“Oh?” the dwarf said, hiking up one of his eyebrows.
<br><br>
“They&#39;re quite powerful, actually. They&#39;re derived from a rather complex series of chemical interactions starting out with potassium hydroxide, and ending with something with a bit less bang to it than a rather small nuclear weapon.”
<br><br>
“And you just &hellip; got &hellip; them?”
<br><br>
“Kind of. That&#39;s another thing, the goblins&#39; labs are completely mechanized, so it was no big deal to synthesize it. Then I just set some co-ordinates in their teleport system, and I got them.”
<br><br>
“And how did you manage to gain access to the teleportation system?”
<br><br>
“Hacked the whole ship.”
<br><br>
“Of course.” the dwarf nodded, as if to say he understood everything. Of course, the dwarf didn&#39;t understand everything, and never claimed that he would be able to know everything, and didn&#39;t even really want to know everything. The nod was more a gesture to the human that he needn&#39;t continue on the behalf of his companion&#39;s enlightening.
<br><br>
“By the way,” Frederick said after a brief pause, “you&#39;re probably sitting on them.”
<br><br>
“What?!” the dwarf screamed.
<br><br>
“Yep. All hooked up to a detonator and ready to go. Covered in a protective coating so they don&#39;t blow up out of the blue, of course, but still.”
<br><br>
The dwarf spotted the explosive device next to him, and proceeded to open the airlock above him, shove the device in it, close the lock, and expel the device into space, along with the detonator.
<br><br>
“You stupid idiot!” Frederick shouted. “How are we supposed to detonate it if we have no detonator?! That was our escape plan!”
<br><br>
“What? Oh no, no need to worry about them blowing up.”
<br><br>
Frederick looked at the dwarf, the dwarf gazing back at him with a knowing smile.
<br><br>
“I&#39;m a xenopsychologist by trade. I know how these people think.”
<br><br>
<hr>
<br>
“This is A-27. Spotted two small objects being expelled from back of enemy fighter. Please advise.”
<br><br>
“This Omega Wing Leader to A-27. What do the objects appear to be.”
<br><br>
“Sensors indicate a stable silicate compound.”
<br><br>
“Are they on direct trajectory to collide with you or anybody else?”
<br><br>
“Yes.”
<br><br>
“Destroy them when they come in range.”
<br><br>
A-27 waited a few minutes for the objects to come into range. He locked his cross-hairs on the small objects and shot at them. He saw a bright light, and that was the last thing he observed of the matter.
<br><br>
<hr>
<br>
A bright light flashed behind Frederick and his companion. The goblins had been traveling in such close formation that they were all incinerated, yet Frederick had managed to get enough of a lead on them that the explosion did not affect him and the dwarf. The entirety of the Fenestration fighter crew had been eliminated, and due to some other hacking that Frederick had performed while still aboard, the Fenestration would not be able to summon forth the energy required to make a hyperspace jump for some time, meaning that Frederick and the dwarf where, for the most part, free. Frederick began broadcasting a distress signal to nearby allied ships, hoping to get rescued at some point.
<br><br>
“I do say, I don&#39;t believe I know your name.” Frederick said to his companion.
<br><br>
“Unimportant.”
<br><br>
“Aw, come on. I&#39;ve a feeling this will be a very long ride.”
<br><br>
“Psht. Humans haven&#39;t the least appreciation for the finest dwarf names.”
<br><br>
“Alright, promise I won&#39;t laugh.”
<br><br>
After a long pause, the dwarf consented.
<br><br>
“Gomwell. Gomwell Isbard.”
<br><br>
Frederick was slightly amused by the name, but managed to keep his composure.
<br><br>
“My name is Frederick Hobbes.” he said to the dwarf.
<br><br>
“Oh really then?”
<br><br>
“Yes.”
<br><br>
“Hmm. You struck me as more of a Kierkegaard, if you ask me.”
<br><br>
“What? I ––”
<br><br>
“Yes, you&#39;re most certainly a Kierkegaard.”
<br><br>
“But that would be absurd!”
<br><br>
“If you didn&#39;t accept the fact that your a Kierkegaard, it very well may be.”
<br><br>
“But—no!”
<br><br>
“But yes. From now on, you&#39;re Frederick Kierkegaard, if you ask me.”
<br><br>
“But that&#39;s not my name!”
<br><br>
“Well it is now.”
<br><br>
Frederick sighed, none to pleased at this sudden change in his surname. Gomwell lifted a magazine that he had found in the cavern, and decided that he might as well pass the time reading in an attempt to ignore the intense pain in his leg. Before he had the chance to open the plastic cover protecting it, however, Frederick snatched it away.
<br><br>
“Vintage stuff, my friend.” Frederick said. “No way I&#39;d let anyone touch it. Not even myself.”
<br><br>
“Alright, first, how do you know it&#39;s vintage?” asked the dwarf.
<br><br>
“How do I know? It&#39;s mine.”
<br><br>
“How &hellip; the &hellip; .”
<br><br>
“I&#39;ll tell you, the goblins have the craft of teleportation worked down to a science. Or a magic, rather, considering that all they ever use is sorcery.
<br><br>
“They keep everything they strip off of you. In my case, it happened to be my clothes, a fountain pen, and a copy of this iconic 1973 issue of an Earth magazine. It&#39;s popularly considered one of the greatest magazine covers in all history. I mean, look at that canine, isn&#39;t he cute?”
<br><br>
“Looks like he got into a spot of trouble, if you ask me.”
<br><br>
“Huh? Oh, well never mind that. Just a marketing technique.”
<br><br>
“Quite effective amongst your people, I&#39;m sure.”
<br><br>
“Quite.”
<br><br>
A brief silence ensued.
<br><br>
“Now what?” asked the dwarf.
<br><br>
“We wait, hoping someone will rescue us.”</p>
