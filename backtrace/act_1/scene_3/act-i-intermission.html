The sky was a dark gray, a sickening shade of death and despair against the sludge-like hue of the horizon. A storm threatened to drench the area, but then, storms were always threatening on this world. A harsh current of air sprung fresh from the earth whipped at the face of the lone figure walking on along the old abandoned road. A hoarse whistle raised its whining pitch above the sound of the wind as the figure paused and looked around at the desolation that surrounded her. She was in the place where no life grew.
<br><br>
The Carlsfax district had been such for many years. It had once flowered and thrived as other parts of the world, but the creatures who had infested Aurelia had ushered in Destruction along with the Age of Oppression. Carlsfax was no longer the wide stretch of fields and meadows it had once been. A torrent of Hellish Fire had been swept across the land, a response to a rebellion from the early days of Foreign Rule. A barren vista of dirt and rock remained from that day of revolt nearly two hundred years past.
<br><br>
The figure trudged on, her boots sticking slightly in the mud formed by the rain of the night just past. The wind died slightly, and a strange cry rose above the noise of the air&#39;s rush, a cry which the figure heard distinct from that of the wind. It was a strange sound, the wail of a thousand creatures in one, begging for the mercy of the people. The figure continued on.
<br><br>
The wailing increased as the figure traveled further along the rough, unformed road. The wind prevented her from detecting the sound&#39;s source even for as much as she strained her ears. A strong gust caused her to whip her head to the left and shield her face with her hood. She spotted a small black bundle in a ditch maybe thirty feet from the edge of the road, a package to which she felt inextricably drawn. The figure walked slowly towards the bundle. She stooped down to overturn a loose flap of the fabric covering the object inside, and she immediately leaped back as she gazed upon a new born child.
<br><br>
The child began to kick and scream violently in response to the weak light let through by the clouds above. The figure watched in horror, looking at him in terror, never before having seen a child like this. His skin was a pure brazen, blinding white, and a white shock of hair crowned his head. The only color in the child was to be found in his eyes, which burned forth the brightest red that the figure had ever seen.
<br><br>
The figure crept slowly back to him, first on her feet, then on her hands and knees. She lifted him up, and the child was placated by the firm hold of the Mater. The child wiggled his arms lightly, and papped the nose of the Mater. She laughed and smiled.
<br><br>
Few traveled the old road any longer. It was implausible that any other would happen across the child. Even one that might would most likely choose to turn the child over to High Court to be “dealt with” in a manner suiting the Priests, as all children were who displayed abnormal characteristics. The Mater was the only chance for the child, and she realized that as she held him close in her arms. She kissed him lightly on the forehead.
<br><br>
The Mater walked back onto the road. The wind had dropped, and now only a slight whistle was to be heard throughout the whole of Carlsfax.
