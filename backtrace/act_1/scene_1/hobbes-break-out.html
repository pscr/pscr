<p><em>A shot glared in the night.
“Captain! We have goblins upon us!” Cathy shouted.
<br/><br/>
“All hands on deck!” the captain shouted back. “Bear 30° east! Arm the phase transition cannons and prepare for battle! Frederick! What are you doing! I said 30° east!”
<br/><br/>
“I can&#39;t!” Frederick shouted back at the captain as he pressed all manner of buttons and turned a superfluous number of dials to no avail. “The ship won&#39;t respond!”
The ship bore towards the Fenestration, even as the crossmodus starship fought against it. A deep web of sorcery had been cast upon the doomed ship, and there was —</em>
<br/><br/>
Frederick snapped out of his dreamy stupor. He supposed that it would be a good idea to attempt an escape. He looked around at the industrial strength steel being used to hold him. He got up and rapped upon one of the walls, a thin layer of film soon finding itself upon his knuckles.
<br/><br/>
“<em>Goblins.</em>” he muttered under his breath.
<br/><br/>
A soft tap resonated within the depths of the ship, a light ca-chunk sounded, as of some long forgotten part of the ship&#39;s mechanism suddenly raising an exception to the actions of an oft used hydraulic. A loud screech then echoed throughout the entirety of the ship, which was quickly quieted by the goblins&#39; sorcery. Such sounds were simply another indication as to the poorly thought out design of Fenestrations.
<br/><br/>
Frederick got down on his hands and knees and managed to fit his fingers into a small crack he had found in a corner of the room. The presence of his digits was immediately met by a rather nasty electric shock. The continuing usage of hotfix patches in 3rd or 4th generations of ships that were actually used to shore up security issues and basic design flaws originating in the first generation of the ship was another sign of the poor thinking that went into the design of the Fenestrations.
<br/><br/>
Frederick thought a bit about how he might be able to exploit the crack despite the protection the goblins&#39; sorcery bestowed upon it. He spotted a large bucket of dirtied water in the opposite corner of the room. The goblins had probably intended that the imprisoned should drink such water, but Frederick was going to use it for something else. He walked over and, as it was significantly heavier than what he could carry on his shoulders, began to shuffle it over back to where the crack was. When he was about twelve feet out from it, the bucket slipped from his control, releasing its contents out upon the steel lined floor. Dozens of gallons of old algae (or something) ridden water made its way to the small opening, and upon reaching it, the fluid overloaded the spell cast upon it to keep it shut. Something similar to an electrical short circuit occurred, during which time the water completely disappeared and the steel walls were warped to ridiculous proportions. It appeared that the local spells used to hold the walls straight and together had broken as well, providing ample opportunity for ready escape.

Frederick stepped out into the underlying cross-structures of the ship.</p>
