<p>Frederick looked around at the area surrounding him. Aluminum rods stemmed every which way, each finding some endpoint co-terminal with at least five others, and in some cases nine or eleven. The origin of the Fenestration could be clearly seen, yet it was obvious that the SFIX design had been warped and changed, handicapped beyond recognition. The SFIX design and its various derivatives, first modeled and built at ChimeLabs near the beginning of the century, looked felt and operated with smooth efficiency and watertight security. In the case of all Fenestrations, however, such efficiency had evaporated like dry ice in the sun, and the security had been banished in the hopes of creating a more “pilot friendly” environment. A few Fenestrations were saved through the installation of SFIX derivatives such as <em>PaxAliis</em> as the system control program, and by the restoration of more stable structural designs, but even these crossmodi, as they were oft called, did not operate with the same smooth purring motions as did those originally built with <em>PaxAliis</em>.

Frederick didn&#39;t know whether or not his ship had survived. He didn&#39;t know whether or not any of his crew mates were still alive. Their lives were in a state superposition to him, left undetermined by the laws of quantum mechanics. His captain could well have been killed in a blast, or his fellow helmsman by asphyxiation. He knew not any of the whereabouts of those he knew. He felt, however, that given his current situation, the most prudent idea would be to attempt to gather useful information for his superiors, or at any rate, his superiors&#39; superiors.
<br/><br/>
Under normal conditions, Frederick would have employed his rather large repertoire of hacking skills in order to gain access to the enemies&#39; data systems unnoticed. However, having been stripped by the goblins of all electronic equipment, he had nothing that he could easily use to demonstrate the accumulated knowledge of many years of hobbying in advanced penetration testing.

A rather loud metallic clang sounded above him, one that didn&#39;t sound like the routine interrupts caught in a Fenestration. A small, dark object dropped before him, in complete silence, something with a vaguely humanoid form, yet vastly shorter than any grown man. The figure had landed in a crouching position, and slowly straightened to its full vertical length. It turned around slowly to face Hobbes, who had remained motionless in hopes of going undetected. “What are you doin&#39; here?” a gruff voice asked in the darkness.
<br/><br/>
“Probably the same as you.” Hobbes replied. “Trying to get off this blasted ship. Maybe get some information, figure out if any of my crew mates survived, maybe nab some information on the enemy.”
<br/><br/>
“Eh.” the voice replied. “You an elf?”
<br/><br/>
“No. I&#39;m human.”
<br/><br/>
“Hegh. Ya&#39;re a good four inches too short to be an elf. A bit tall for a man, on the other hand. You one of those damn crossbreeds?”
<br/><br/>
“No, I&#39;m a human. Pure blooded.”
<br/><br/>
“You sure? &#39;Cause ya sure look to have some elvish blood in ya if ya ask me.”
<br/><br/>
“I&#39;m absolutely sure, I&#39;m a human, all the way up my genetic lineage. Or down, if you prefer.”
<br/><br/>
The small creature paused a minute to breath. He (at least, it appeared to be a he) seemed to have been running a considerable distance, and fear emanated from his body.
<br/><br/>
“I can promise you I&#39;m not a goblin.” Hobbes told the stout figure.
<br/><br/>
“Oh, well I knew <em>that</em>.” the figure replied. “Can smell them coming a mile away.”
<br/><br/>
“Ah, yes. I&#39;m guessing that you are running from them.”
<br/><br/>
“Well wouldn&#39;t you?”
<br/><br/>
“Yes, well, I&#39;m guessing that you have done something that angered them.”
<br/><br/>
“A simple misunderstanding! All I did was gouge one&#39;s eyes out and shove another&#39;s head into the wall, which created a security breach, allowing me to escape. I mean, things hadn&#39;t even turned nasty yet. It was all for play.”
<br/><br/>
“Um–”
<br/><br/>
“Oh, here they come! Toodaloo, good sir!”
<br/><br/>
Frederick heard the pounding of the goblins&#39; feet and soon sensed the odorous wafts that traveled out in waves before them. He needed to effect a disappearance.</p>
