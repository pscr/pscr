<p>Frederick was still determined to find information, and felt that locating a system terminal would be best the best method of doing so. Having a rather detailed idea of the physical layout of Fenestrations, he managed to figure out that there was a maintenance tunnel nearby him. He made his way to it, climbing amongst the bars making up the ship&#39;s understructure. The goblins ran beneath him, a few peeling off and following him, having detected him by their sorcerous ways. He quickened his pace, and soon reached the door to the tunnel. Escape from the creatures below him seemed possible, yet the cover on the passageway failed to open, having been rusted shut from years of disuse. He put his back against the door, breathing heavily as he eyed the taser-like apparatuses of the goblins warming up in preparation for disabling their prey. They were still a few hundred feet below, and the weapons were out of their range. Frederick took hold of one of the bar providing support, intending to swing himself around it and continue fleeing, but the rod appeared to be a bit too loose to provide stable support. Groping around thoroughly on the bar, however, he found a small pocket knife that someone had strapped to it.

The door opened after some prying with the knife, and Frederick quickly rushed in and shut it. He felt the impact of a few projectiles against it as he closed and locked it. He proceeded to rush down the ill-lit maintenance shaft, and, upon opening another breech door, found himself in a small corridor. He peered around and spotted a pictograph like sign that directed him in the direction of the turbine room. He knew exactly where he was. He proceeded down the hallway and came to another breech door, this time with a combination lock, above which were inscribed, in a most beautiful golden font, some incomprehensible alien characters that seemed to state the purpose for the existence of the room, and a disclaimer directly beneath the characters, written in Universal Code, warning that the door was for authorized use only, and thus that that which was behind was only to be seen with authorized eyes.
<br><br>
Frederick tried the default code for the door. He had found many times before that ship owners would often keep the factory-default passwords, opening up their vessels to a slew of vulnerabilities. It was not so in this case, however, and so Frederick, fully aware of the natural consequences of this action, stabbed the keypad square in its middle. Alarms went off immediately, alerting the crew that a breach of security had just occurred. The door had been jarred open, however, as the electromagnetic locking system no longer had any power that might be used to produce the necessary fields to keep the door drawn shut. He swiftly opened the door to its widest, and leaped through into the turbine room. He jumped over pipes and propelled himself off of the turbines themselves, feeling the rapid spinning beneath the steel outer shell. He sprang for the staircase leading to the turbine control room, and ascended it quickly. He was about to stab this door as well, in a similar manner as he did the other, but before he could do so, the door opened of its own volition, allowing for the exit of three armed goblins. Before the goblins had time to recover from the surprise of having human at the very door of the control room, Frederick had already dispatched one of them, and with that one&#39;s gun, the other two provided little problem.

Frederick jammed himself into the chair present, taking in the view of the control panel. The current user had not logged out, and so Frederick had the opportunity to quite easily hack the system. He attempted to download the open source <em>PaxAliis</em> control software, and initiated the process without issue. He then told the mainframe to run the setup when the file had finished processing, which caused the system to prompt for an administrator password. Frederick entered the appropriate hexadecimal that would give the current user administrative privileges. The Fenestration system denied him the ability to run the software at first, but then, seeing that he was now an administrator, went along about its normal business, and let him do pretty much whatever he wanted. Frederick opened a Fenestration Pseudo-Terminal and shut off all the alarms. He changed the passwords on all the doors leading to the turbine room back to their defaults (which happened to simply be a series of six consecutive digits) and locked them. He then set off alarms near the bridge, and made the lights in the front half of the ship flicker. He then grabbed a flash card that happened to be lying on the desk on a key-chain and stuck it into the data drive. He then went searching for sensitive information.
