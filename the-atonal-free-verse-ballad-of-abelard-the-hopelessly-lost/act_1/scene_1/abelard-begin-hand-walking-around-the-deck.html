<p>As he could not unbind his legs, Abelard decided to find another way to get around.  He pushed himself up into a standing position, dropped himself forward, and began to walk around the deck on his hands.  What ingenuity he had!  Only he would think of such things!<br>

However, it turned out that genius had nothing to do with that, because within seconds he lost his balance and fell forward.  It didn&#39;t help that he couldn&#39;t see where he was going.  If he did, he would have seen what was in front of him: the captain who had captured him, locked in combat up until now.  All he knew was that as he fell forward, his legs came in contact with someone.  That someone fell over and began yelling.  That someone&#39;s yelling was, for whatever reason, quickly getting farther and farther away.  Then, that someone&#39;s yelling stopped when there was a large splash.<br>

Abelard sat up to find himself near the edge of the boat.  Two of the unfamiliar pirates were now staring at him in bewilderment.  He looked and saw in front of him the crown that the familiar captain always wore.  Now he understood.  He raised his fists up and looked to the heavens, celebrating.<br>
<br>
Victory was his!</p>
