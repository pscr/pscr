<p>Immediately the crew members dashed backward a few paces, then looked at each other in amazement and fear.  For a moment, everything was silent.  Then, they heard the other ship&#39;s captain yell, “Fire!” and were drenched by another large splash in front of the ship.  The pirates scattered, running in all directions to avoid the next shot.  Some of them bumped into Abelard, which for him was very irritating.<br>
<br>
Currently Abelard was flailing about in his bonds trying to imitate a magical dance he once saw that warded off the fear of all in the vicinity.  Right now, he very much needed the Terrified Dance, as he himself was quite afraid at the moment.  Sadly, he couldn&#39;t really do the dance properly when bound, so all around would have to settle for the motivating words of the captain.<br>
<br>
“Cease the panic!  They may&#39;ve damaged our ship, but there&#39;s a perfectly sound one right over there!  Get your weapons ready, men!  They can&#39;t stop us from boardin&#39; now!”<br>
<br>
This made the pirates a little more optimistic, and they did as the captain ordered.  Indeed, the ships were getting quite close.  Abelard could now make out the crew of the other ship, and the infamous trebuchet.  It seemed that the boulders used by the trebuchet were being conjured as needed by a young wizard on the deck.  Those who weren&#39;t operating the trebuchet were watching the crew of their target ship and occasionally jeering at them.<br>
<br>
As they got closer, the ship was pelted with two or three more boulders, but it refused to sink, and the crew was no longer panicking.  They would get out of the way of the boulders but not scatter completely.  Soon, the ships were right next to each other, about four feet apart.  Bloodshed was immanent&hellip;</p>
