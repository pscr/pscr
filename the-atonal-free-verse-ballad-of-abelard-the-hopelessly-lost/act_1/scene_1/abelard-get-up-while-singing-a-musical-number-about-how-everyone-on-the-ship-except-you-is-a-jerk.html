<p>Abelard once again began the rocking, trying to get back up on his feet.  His plans were to go forward, and no man was to stop him!  As he struggled to rise, he needed a way to ease his escalating frustration.  Oh how these horrible men tried his patience!  But he needed a clear head to succeed, so he released his anger in song.

The gag was becoming a problem again.  In response to the song, the first mate kicked him again.
<br><br>
“Shut up!  Annoy me any more an&#39; I&#39;ll slash ya &#39;til ya stop movin&#39;!  Now, are you lot ready!”
<br><br>
“Aye!”
<br><br>
“Alright then.  We&#39;ll be close enough to board before long.”
<br><br>
Indeed, the other ship was close enough that Abelard could hear its captain shouting orders.
<br><br>
“Yarg!  They be close enough, me mateys!  Load the trebuchet!”
<br><br>
Hearing this, the pirates around Abelard whispered to each other in confusion.
<br><br>
“A trebuchet on a ship?  How are they supposed to use that?”
<br><br>
“They&#39;ve gotta be crazy to think that&#39;ll work.  Storin&#39; rocks like that would sink the ship!”
<br><br>
The chatter was interrupted by a big splash right in front of them.
<br><br>
“Well, that&#39;s that!” said the first mate to the crew.  “So much for their mighty trebuchet, eh?  That&#39;s gotta be their only boulder!  Ha!  They ain&#39;t so great, are they?”
<br><br>
The crew laughed in agreement and yelled battle cries.
<br><br>
“Let&#39;s show them how a real crew fights!  Waitin&#39; on your orders to board, cap-”
<br><br>
Just then another boulder of similar size made a large hole in the deck where the first mate once stood.</p>
