<p>In his pondering, Abelard had an interesting idea.  He wasn&#39;t sure what “wifi” or a “website” was, and he had never heard of anyone who registered accounts for a city&#39;s forum, but he liked the parts that he understood.  Although, he didn&#39;t really think it counted as mutiny, considering that he wasn&#39;t actually part of the crew.  He also wasn&#39;t sure that one can seize a ship whilst gagged and bound at the hands and feet, but he figured that more unbelievable tasks have been done.  He made a plan, and began to put it in motion.
<br><br>
Abelard began rocking back and forth in his sitting position until eventually he was standing in a crouch.  He then began his waddle, a waddle which would become legendary among all those who suffered at the hands of these pirates.  While he waddled, he calculated: he moved about 2 inches per second, making for 10 feet per minute.  In about 2 minutes, he would reach the stairs up to the bow, where the captain stood at the wheel.  The wretch would never expect what was about to befall him&hellip;
<br><br>
The pirates sitting nearby watched Abelard in mild amusement.
<br><br>
“Ha!  Where&#39;s he tryin&#39; to go?”
<br><br>
“Looks like he wants to get to the bow.”
<br><br>
“Hahaha!  Think he&#39;ll get within a yard of the stairs before he gets tired and falls over?”
<br><br>
“Nah, you&#39;re givin&#39; him too much credit.  I say halfway.”
<br><br>
“You willin&#39; to put a bet on that, mate?”
<br><br>
Sadly, their gamble was interrupted by a call from the lookout: “Ship approaching from the starboard!  Flies an unfamiliar Jolly Roger!”
<br><br>
Hearing this, the captain began shouting orders: “On deck, all of you!  Prepare for boarding!  Let&#39;s see what sorts of riches this crew&#39;s gathered together!”
<br><br>
Immediately all of the sitting crew members stood and got ready to fight, grinning as they imagined the spoils.  The deck that was once mostly stagnant became a bustle of activity.  The first mate was walking around, making sure that everything was going smoothly.  In the midst of this, he came across their prisoner, trying to waddle along the deck.  At first the first mate stopped and watched this in mild confusion, but then he kicked the prisoner over onto his side.</p>
